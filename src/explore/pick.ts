/**
 * What a tap in the World Explorer picks (E323; src/explore/Select.ts draws the selection). Pure: no DOM, so
 * test/select-pick.test.ts runs it.
 *
 *   const hit = pickTarget(raycaster, targets);   // { target, point, box } | null
 *   copyInTheWay(ray, far, look, targets)         // VIEW IN WORLD (E342): another copy between the eye and the one it frames
 *
 * Each object is raycast once per tap, however many targets share it (a Nine Dragon kit carries seven models' copies:
 * it was raycast seven times). The nearest surface hit is what the finger touched. On that object a target with `claim`
 * takes the hit only where one of its copies stands (the smallest copy box holding the point wins), a target without one
 * takes any hit on its object, and a hit nobody claims picks nothing: a bare facade or Well wall belongs to the world,
 * never to a baked piece metres away (the nearest copy used to win with no containment check). When nothing takes the
 * hit, a copy box the ray entered in front of it does: the tap threaded that copy's open shape — between a mahjong
 * table's legs, past a laundry line's cloth — and landed on the world behind. A box behind the surface never does.
