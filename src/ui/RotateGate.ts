/**
 * Rotate gate (E38): Wildshard is portrait-only on phones. The page itself is index.html's `.ws-rotate`, shown by a
 * media query in src/ui/styles/rotate.css the instant the device turns (no JS needed to paint it); this module does
 * the rest while it is up:
 *
 *   - swallows input: every press / key / wheel that starts behind the page is stopped at the window, capture phase
 *     (releases — pointerup / pointercancel / keyup — still go through, so nothing is left held down);
 *   - pauses a running game: `ws:background` (HUD: pause into the menu if riding, never unpause), so turning back to
 *     portrait lands on the pause menu, not mid-fight;
 *   - `rotateGated()` — main.ts adds it to the frame gate, so the world neither ticks nor renders behind the page.
 *
 * Keyed on `(pointer: coarse)`, never on the ?touch flag: a desktop is landscape by nature, `?touch` on one is not
 * gated. `min-aspect-ratio: 5/4` keeps a portrait phone whose soft keyboard squashed the viewport (the review
 * composer) from counting as landscape.
