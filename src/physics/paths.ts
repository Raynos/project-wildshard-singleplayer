/**
 * The paths as walkways (PHYSICS.md P4, "anything steeper that a route needs gets a ramp collider"): the character
 * motor won't climb ground past 40°, and the sand paths cross ground that steep — sideways on a hillside, or up a
 * short crag lip. Each path is resampled every half metre; its height profile is the terrain under the centreline, lifted
 * (never lowered) so that no half-metre along it is steeper than `maxGradeDeg`. Wherever the ground is steep there
 * (terrain normal past `steepDeg`) or the profile had to be lifted, a thin board is laid along the path on that
 * profile, level across. So a path is walkable as a path while the slope beside it stays a slope. A lift of more than
 * `maxLift` is a cliff the path doesn't really climb (the trailside's steps do, or nothing): no board there.
