/**
 * Loads Rapier (docs/plans/PHYSICS.md §Architecture, Loading). The only module that instantiates the WASM; every
 * other physics module imports Rapier's API from here, after `loadRapier()` resolved.
 *
 * The binary is fetched from /assets/physics/rapier.wasm (vite/rapier.ts copies it there from the package) and
 * compiled with `instantiateStreaming`, so compilation overlaps the download and runs off the main thread. `loadRapier()`
 * is called at the very start of boot and awaited by the `physics` step, by which time it has usually finished.
 * SIMD build only: the iOS app targets 17 and the web build needs Safari ≥ 16.4.
