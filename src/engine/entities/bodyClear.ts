 * (then the player's own knock-back does the rest). No motor, no move (E323: physics owns collision, nothing is pushed
 * blind into a wall). No motor means a ridden horse (Mount's body carries it) or a world without physics: every live,
 * shown animal near the player has one, since CreatureBodies.sync runs first in the update. True when it pushed.
