/**
 * AnimalManager (the sim half, P1-E4.3; AnimalHerdView.ts draws) — spawns the chunk's huntable wildlife (the active ShardManifest's `fauna` herd plans),
 * runs their AI at 10 Hz (idle / graze / wander / alert / flee / charge / stalk / dead), animates
 * them every frame, and exposes the combat + audio hooks.
 *
 *   const animals = new AnimalManager(new AnimalHerdView(scene, sky), app, forest).build();
 *   game.onUpdate((dt, t) => animals.update(dt, t, player.position, player.sprinting));
 *
 *   animals.raycast(origin, dir, maxDist) → { animal, point, distance, headshot, damage } | null  (result object is reused;
 *                                          `damage` = DAMAGE model (Animal.ts) for that hit: body 32–40 with distance falloff past 40 m, head ×2.5)
 *   animal.applyDamage(amount, hitPoint, dir) → true if it died   (deer 60 hp, boar 100 hp; variants override — Old Ironhide 300)
 *   animals.hit(hit, dir)  — convenience: applyDamage(hit.damage)
 *   animals.disturb(point, strength) — a bolt landed / something loud happened here: animals within
 *                                      impactSpook m bolt, within impactAlert m go alert (Combat calls it on misses)
 *   animals.nearRay(origin, dir, maxDist, tol) → the animal whose head/body passes within `tol` m of the ray (aim assist / "was I aiming at it")
 *   Blood burst + ground decal, sounds, AI reaction and onKill all fire from applyDamage.
 *   animal.fadeOut()  — dissolve a harvested carcass over 1.5 s (animal.hidden afterwards)
 *
 * The hunting loop (DEER_TUNING / BOAR_TUNING below): every animal carries an `awareness` meter 0..1. It rises while the
 * player is inside the SIGHT cone (body heading ± sightCone, out to sightRange — far less while grazing head-down) or
 * inside the HEARING radius (any direction; grows with the player's speed: still < crouch < walk < sprint), and decays
 * otherwise. At `alertAt` the head comes up and the animal FREEZES staring at you for freezeMin..freezeMax s — that is
 * the shot window — then bolts if it still senses you (`boltAt`), or relaxes back to grazing after `relaxAfter` s. It
 * flees at `runSpeed` (faster than a sprinting player) but only until `fleeUntil..fleeUntilMax` m away, then stops, looks
 * back, and grazes again — "wary" (sharper senses) for `waryTime` s. A hit that does not kill bolts it at once. One
 * spooked animal alerts its herd within `herdAlertRadius` m. Boars charge when hit or when the player is within
 * `chargeDist` m. HUNTERS (a species whose HuntTuning has `stalk` — the bear) never bolt: the alert freeze
 * ends in a STALK (walking the player down, huffing) that becomes a charge inside panicDist, and a charge that
 * lands or times out drops back into the stalk after `stalk.rechargeCd` s until the player is `stalk.giveUp` m away.
 *
 *   animals.onKill   = (animal) => …
 *   animals.onCharge = (animal, damage) => …          a boar reached the player
 *   animals.onSound  = (name, position) => …          'deer_call' | 'boar_grunt' | 'hoofsteps' | 'boar_squeal'
 *   animals.onWindup = (animal) => …                  melee shards: an attack's wind-up began (the charge telegraph, a crab's
 *                                                     claw raise, the sailor's cutlass) — play its cue (the level's wind-up voice)
 *   animals.animals: Animal[]   animals.alive (count)
 *
 * Species + variants: every kind comes from the species registry (`src/engine/entities/species/<kind>.ts`, see
 * AnimalFactory.ts). Each spawn rolls a VariantDef by weight with the seeded rng — its `scale`, `hp` and `mods`
 * (speed / chargeDist / damageTaken / chargeDamage / relentless) are applied HERE on top of the species'
 * HuntTuning (DEER_TUNING / BOAR_TUNING below stay the untouched baseline; a species may ship its own
 * `tuning`). A 'legendary' variant is capped at ONE alive per kind (the roll falls back to the rare tier).
 * HerdPlan.variants restricts a herd's pool to those ids.
 *
   * Dev helpers: animals.spawn(kind, x, z, yaw, variant?, placement?) adds a single animal (no herd AI target) — `variant`
 * is a variant id ('ironhide') or an id list to roll from; omitted = the species' full weighted table.
 * animals.debug = true draws the hit capsules, animals.calm = true stops them reacting to the player.
 *
 * Species that THINK FOR THEMSELVES (`SpeciesDef.think` — Driftwood Isle's Reef Crab / Coconut Monkey / Drowned Sailor,
 * src/shards/driftwood-isle/creatures/Enemies.ts spawns them): the manager still owns spawning, per-frame animation, hit tests, blood, sounds,
 * onKill and the corpse, but their 10 Hz tick goes to the species' `think(animal, ThinkCtx)` instead of the senses /
 * flee / charge loop above, and a hit does not push them into flee / charge. Their damage to the player arrives through
 * the same `onCharge(animal, damage)`. `animals.enemyWorld` (EnemyWorld) is what the shard hands those AIs: palm
 * perches, the coconut thrower, the wreck's hold — Enemies.ts fills it; a missing piece degrades to ground behaviour.
 * `animals.addHerd(kind, cx, cz)` makes a herd for such a spawner (`spawn()` then `animal.herd = index`).
 *
 * MELEE SHARDS (`meleeShard(ShardManifest)`: 'sword' / 'nalati', Driftwood C5 — Pine Hollow's crossbow hunting is untouched): every attack
 * is telegraphed and lands on an arc, so strafing is the dodge.
 *   • A charge starts with a WIND-UP (CHARGE_WINDUP: boar 0.55 s, bear 0.65 s): the animal stops, turns to you, drops its
 *     head and paws the ground (Animal.poseWindup) with the roar / grunt as the cue, then runs. A sword blow during the
 *     wind-up interrupts it (Animal.stagger cancels the attack → `staggered` sends it back to alert / stalk).
 *   • A running charge connects per frame, not at 10 Hz, and only if you are inside CHARGE_ARC of its heading when it
 *     reaches you; inside the last CHARGE_COMMIT m it can barely turn — sidestep late and it thunders past.
 *   • The self-thinking species' strikes (crab snap, monkey bite, cutlass) only hurt inside HURT_ARC of the attacker's
 *     facing, and while an attack runs the animal turns at most ATTACK_TURN rad/s (Animal.attackTurnCap): a wind-up
 *     commits to a direction you can step out of.
 *   • No hit through solid geometry (E296 — the wreck's hold, where the sailor cut you from behind the mast and beams):
 *     a strike or a charge only lands when `canReach` — the physics `lineOfSight` from your chest to the attacker's finds
 *     nothing (a hull wall, a beam, a deck, a rock) short of the attacker's own body. Asked only on the frame a hit would
 *     land; `ThinkCtx.reach` lets a species skip a swing it could not land (the sailor does).
 *
 * FIGHT RULES (E297, `ShardManifest.fight.attackers` — Driftwood only; src/engine/shared/entities/fightRules.ts): one set of rules for every enemy.
 *   • At most `maxAttackers` (2) attack at once: a charge (wind-up + run) or a species' strike needs an attack token
 *     (`tokens`; `ThinkCtx.claim` / `mayAttack`); the rest hold back on a ring and wait. A token goes back when the
 *     charge ends / the strike's attackPhase drops below 0 (swept every think tick), or at once on leaving 'charge'.
 *   • Boars fight like the bears: a boar gets a synthesized `stalk` (RULES_STALK) — it does not bolt when it notices you,
 *     it comes for you. After a charge (landed, missed, timed out or broken by a blow) a charger BACKS OFF past the ring
 *     (`backoffPoint`, ≤ BACKOFF_MAX_T s), then circles on it (RING: boar 6.5 m, bear 7.5 m) facing you until its
 *     cooldown (RULES_CD_HIT 3.4 s / RULES_CD_MISS 2.0 s) and a token let it turn, wind up and charge again (`reengage`).
 *     Only a nearly dead (< 25 %), non-relentless one may break off after a hit (50 %).
 *   • A big animal's body never swallows the camera (`clearBody`, per frame): a boar / bear / deer body closer to the
 *     player than its radius + the player's capsule + a margin is moved back out, through its physics motor.
 *   • `isThreat(a)` says an attack is coming (a charge's wind-up or run, a strike's wind-up) — src/engine/client/ui/WindupWarn.ts draws
 *     the off-screen warning from it.
