/**
 * VIEW IN WORLD's eye (E342): where the World Explorer camera lands to show one copy of a model. The old framing — a
 * three-quarter view 2.2 r out and 0.9 r up, r the copy's bounding sphere (at least 3 m) — stood the camera inside Nine
 * Dragon's stack, a metre from a wall or a pipe, so the copy was hidden and a tap at the centre picked the wall (6 / 20).
 *
 *   const eyes = viewCandidates(box);                     // the old framing first, then rings round the copy
 *   const i = firstView(eyes, (eye) => clear(eye));       // the first that passes, in that order (-1: none)
 *   physicsClear(physics, eye, look, box)                 // no collider at the eye or on the way to the copy
 *   roundBlocker(indices, eyes, look, hit)                // the landed search's order round what the centre hit (E345)
 *
 * The candidates: the old framing's distance, then 60 % and 35 % of it (never inside the copy's box), each at the old
 * 22° elevation, 43°, 5° and 69°, each round eight headings — the old one first, then ±45°, ±90°, ±135°, 180°. The old
 * framing stays wherever it is clear (the other shards keep their views); a blocked one moves round the copy, then up,
 * then in. Explore.viewInWorld tests them twice: with the colliders and the drawn-into copy boxes (both whole, whatever
 * the cullers draw) when the flight starts, and with a tap's own pick once it lands.
