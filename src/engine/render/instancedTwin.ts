/**
 * js-heap H1: the material an instanced draw wears. three keeps one current program per material and re-selects it
 * (getParameters, ~100 fields, and its key) whenever that material's draws switch between instanced and plain objects:
 * the idle Template re-selected a look library's family:pbr material twice a frame, drawn by instanced tile props and
 * by an ordinary mesh, and any classic material an instanced and a plain object share does the same. The shadow
 * ownership's draw hook (`shadowMaterialOwnership.ts`) hands each instanced draw of a classic material its twin: an
 * object whose prototype is the material, so every field, map, uniform and compile hook it reads is the material's own,
 * live (a look write, a curve, an emissive switch reach both), while three files the twin's program state apart
 * (renderer properties are keyed by object). Each program variant then compiles once, on the twin or the material
 * (programs are shared by key, so a precompiled variant links nothing again), and neither flips. This is the one allowed
 * second program of a lent look (the look library's no-recompile rule's exception): no shader, value or texture is
 * duplicated. The twin's version and needs-update follow the material's; it has its own events, and goes with the
 * material's dispose. Node materials (their graph is read from their own fields) keep the shared material.
