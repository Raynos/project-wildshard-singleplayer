/**
 * The engine's own render counter (SHARD-PLATFORM SF59 step 2, fix 2; `docs/design/mmo/research/sf59-tsl-spike.md`
 * §2.3).
 *
 * three's `renderer.info.render.frame` counts `renderer.render()` calls, but three's node handler (the TSL back-end,
 * `render/nodes/engineNodesHandler.ts`) also bumps it once per node-material draw to refresh its uniform buffers. So once a
 * graph material is on screen, a reader that took it as "one per render" (the Memory saver's release timing, a shard's
 * once-per-render placement) would run once per draw. The engine counts renders itself instead: `renderCount(renderer)`
 * advances exactly once per `renderer.render()` call, whatever is drawn, and has the value three's counter has with only
 * classic materials on screen (both start at 0 and step at the start of a render, before any draw), so today's readers
 * behave identically.
