/**
 * A level look's light model and fog scoped to one subtree of the page (SHARD-PLATFORM SF63): a grid region's materials
 * compile with its own level's `LookStrategy.lighting` / `fog` while every other material on the page keeps the page's.
 *
 * Why per-material chunk overrides (and not a frame-level switch or a recompiled page): a look's lighting and fog are
 * whole-chunk writes on three's global `ShaderChunk` (toon bands in `lights_physical_pars_fragment`, a ramp or painted
 * fog in `fog_*`), installed once per page before anything compiles. Rewriting the globals at cell entry would recompile
 * every program on the page (the road, the neighbours, the viewmodel) behind a screen on each crossing, and the next
 * neighbour drawn in the same frame would take the wrong look. Instead:
 *
 * 1. `captureLookChunks` runs the level's installs once in a sandbox: it snapshots `ShaderChunk` and the page's fog
 *    uniform list, runs the installs, keeps every chunk they changed and every fog uniform set they added, and puts the
 *    page's chunks and list back exactly. Cached per level id (a look's installs guard themselves to run once a page).
 * 2. `scopeLookChunks` patches each material under the region's root (a `patchShader` entry, last in the chain, so a
 *    material's own `#include <fog_fragment>` edits still land first): every `#include <chunk>` the overrides reach is
 *    inlined with the region's text, the captured fog uniforms are bound on that shader, and its program key gains
 *    `|look:<id>` (a region-keyed program variant: the same material type under the page look keeps its own program).
 *    A material that reaches no overridden chunk (or only fog chunks with `fog: false`) is left alone: no new program.
 *    Materials the asset cache shares (`isShared`) are left alone too (another region may draw them).
 *
 * 3. **Its own frame** (SF63 part 2): a look's chunks are written in its level's own world frame (a slab-edge haze that
 *    starts some metres from the level's centre, cloud shadows tiled on its xz). A grid region is drawn at its cell's offset,
 *    so inside every inlined region chunk of the fragment stage `cameraPosition` and the engine's fog world position
 *    `vFogWorldPos` read relative to the region's origin (`wsLookOrigin`, the root's world position, kept by `sweep`).
 *    The macros wrap the region's chunk text only: a page chunk left as an include inside it, and every other line of the
 *    material, read the page frame as before.
 * 4. **Its per-frame parts** (SF63 part 2): the look's sky dressing (`LookStrategy.sky`) builds inside the same sandbox
 *    (its chunk writes become region overrides; its own uniforms, such as a cloud field, stay its own), and its `update`
 *    and the look's `frame` run from `frame(dt, t)`, which the caller runs only while the player is in the cell.
 *
 * The page's programs and chunk text never change, so a page booted as the level itself (SHARD SELECT) is untouched.
 * The patches leave with the region's scope. Generic engine code (E405): no level is named here.
