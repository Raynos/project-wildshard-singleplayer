/**
 * A shard's own post graph as one pass of the engine's composer (SHARD-PLATFORM SF59 step 4), drawn by its classic GLSL
 * program (nine-fix NF18: the node runtime's `GraphPostPass` it replaces). Each frame the graph's scene input moves to the
 * composer's input buffer (and its depth input to the composer's depth texture, when the pass reads `sceneDepth`:
 * `needsDepthTexture` asks the composer for one), the scene camera's clip range feeds the depth's linearisation, and the
 * graph draws the composer's fullscreen triangle into the output buffer. The pass fades over the scene by its owner weight
 * (`compileClassicGraph(…, { weighted: true })`); at weight 0 it is disabled, so it costs nothing.
