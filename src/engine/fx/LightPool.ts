/**
 * LightPool — a fixed set of scene PointLights driven by intensity only (B7). three.js bakes the NUMBER of lights into
 * every lit program, so adding, removing or hiding (`visible = false`, or hiding a parent) a light mid-play recompiles
 * every lit material in view — a multi-second hitch on iOS. The pool's lights are created during boot (as they are
 * acquired), live in one always-visible group at the scene root, and are never removed: a released light just sits at
 * intensity 0. The pool SEALS itself on the scene's first real render (after the boot's precompile), so from then on
 * the light count is fixed: a mid-play `acquire()` reuses a released light, and when none is free it hands back a
 * detached light (not in the scene: it lights nothing, costs nothing, never recompiles) and warns once.
 *
 *   const light = LightPool.for(scene).acquire(0xffb257, 18, 11, 1.6);   // colour, intensity, distance, decay
 *   light.position.set(x, y, z);                                          // WORLD space (the pool group sits at the origin)
 *   light.intensity = …;                                                  // drive it every frame
 *   LightPool.for(scene).release(light);                                  // intensity 0, free for the next acquire
 *
 * Shadows are never cast by a pooled light. `LightPool.for(scene).size` / `.free` for the perf meter / dev.
 *
 * An `owner` (optional) ties a light to the object it lights for: every render of the pool's scene dims an owned light
 * whose owner, or any ancestor, is hidden or detached, so a parked or retired region's lights keep the count but light
 * nothing (a grid region's own lights would otherwise leave with its root and recompile every lit program on the road).
 *
 * A pool of a scene nested in another (a grid region's own scene, whose content asks `LightPool.for(its scene)`) counts in
 * three's light hash only while its root shows: showing Pine Hollow's region added its five cabin lights to every lit
 * program on the page (each rebuilt: 1 → 6 point lights, ~40 builds of its after-play). The page `reserve`s that many
 * dark lights of its own before its first render, and `mirrorInto` takes the nested pool's lights out of three's count
 * (no layer: no camera sees them) and copies each shown one onto a reserved page light on every page render (colour,
 * intensity, reach, decay, world position), so the page's light count never moves.
