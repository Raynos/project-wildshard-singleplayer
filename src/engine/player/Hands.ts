/**
 * Hands — the first-person viewmodel while swimming: no weapon, just the player's two forearms and hands doing a
 * looping breaststroke at the water line. The hands ALWAYS wear white gloves (a mitten shape with a thumb, over a plain
 * sleeve cuff — no finger detail by design). Styled per level: its `LevelSpec.hands` —
 *   'pbr'     smooth-shaded, on the viewmodels' shared lit program (Crossbow.viewmodelMaterial), IBL-fixed like the crossbow
 *   'toon' faceted: non-indexed geometry, flat vertex colours with a per-facet jitter, `flatShading: true`
 * Both are lit through `sky.setupMaterial()` (CSM shadows + fog). Parented to the camera with its own depth clear
 * (renderOrder 999 / 1000, like the crossbow and the hoverboard) so the arms never clip into the water or the pier.
 *
 *   const hands = new Hands(sky, camera);   // already parented: camera.add(hands.group) — adding it again is harmless
 *   hands.update(dt, player);               // every frame, after player.update(); shows itself only while player.swimming
 *   hands.visible                           // what it decided this frame (read-only in spirit)
 *
 * Animation: idle tread (the hands slowly scull side to side at the surface) when still; a breaststroke cycle
 * (reach forward together → sweep out and pull back → recover under the chin → reach) whose rate follows the swim
 * speed — one cycle per `STROKE_PERIOD` at full speed, the same clock Player uses for `onStroke`, so the sound and
 * the pull line up. Fades in / out over ~0.25 s (scale + drop) when swimming starts / stops.
 *
 * A shard with a skinned arm rig hands one in (`ShardManifest.sword` → `ShardSword.swim`, a `SwimArms`: Driftwood's castaway
 * arms, E334): then there are no gloves — the rig plays its own swim clips (swimStroke / swimTread) on the same clock and
 * speed blend, with the water line drawn on the arms, and it is the same pair of arms the sword is held in.
