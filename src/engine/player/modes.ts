/**
 * The player modes (SHARD-PLATFORM SF34, G3 "fixed core + modes"): the platform owns the core verbs and the HUD; a level
 * runs the approved modes through this one registry. Two kinds:
 *
 * - **Motor modes**, the Player's own law: `foot`, `board` (the hoverboard, player/board.ts), `swim` and `wade` (the water
 *   law, read from the level's water bodies). Every level gets the same rules; a level only supplies water, hover-only
 *   pieces (`Piece.mode`, world/registry.ts) and its swim arms (`LevelSpec.hands.swim`).
 * - **Driven modes** a level brings (`ride`, `grapple`, later `glide` / `climb` / `drive`): a driver that owns the whole
 *   frame (`enter(id, driver)`: input, fixed step and pose, until `exit`), or a traversal that moves the capsule on the
 *   fixed steps it claims (`traverse`). Each declares its input context and the baseline HUD slot that shows it (E332: a
 *   mode never adds or moves a HUD control).
 *
 * The registry is per Player and made on first use (`playerModes(player)`); nothing is installed by importing this file.
 * It adds no motion law: entering a driven mode hands the Player's existing `ride` slot the driver, and a traversal
 * answers the Player's existing `player.traversal` ask, so the motion is the shipping law, step for step.
