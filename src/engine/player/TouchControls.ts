/**
 * TouchControls — on-screen first-person controls for coarse-pointer devices (phones, tablets).
 *
 *   const touch = new TouchControls(player, weapons);    // no-op on mouse/trackpad devices (`touch.active === false`)
 *
 * Layout E (E42, Jake's pick from art/hud/round-10-look-zone/board.jpg), split 45 / 55 (E46, corrected in E58 — Jake: "45%
 * movement, 55% is the right hand section … consists of both the attack and the look pad … the attack button can touch the
 * dividing line on the 55 side", not three equally spaced buttons), portrait, styled in
 * src/engine/ui/styles/touch.css (prefix `ws-touch-`). A see-through glass control bar (67 % solid) runs across the bottom ~15 % of
 * the screen, split by a divider at 45 % (`--split`) into two thumb zones:
 *
 *  - MOVE (the bar's left 45 %): an anchored stick that is always drawn: a thin cyan ring with a glowing cyan knob resting
 *    at its centre, centred in the zone. A touch anywhere in the MOVE zone grabs it; the knob
 *    follows the thumb inside the ring. Pushing past SPRINT_AT while heading forward sprints: the ring's top arc lights and
 *    a SPRINT tag lights just above the bar over the stick. Not floating (declined in E11). The left 45 % above the bar is not a control surface.
 *  - LOOK (the bar's right 55 %, and the right 55 % of the screen above it — CoD Mobile free-look): dragging turns the
 *    camera and NEVER attacks. The LOOK pad (a dashed rounded square as wide as ATTACK, centred in the section's free part)
 *    is its visual, lit while a drag that started in the bar is looking.
 *  - ATTACK disc, in the LOOK section with its left edge on the divider, on the bar's centre line; a touch on the disc is
 *    ATTACK, never a look. Touch-down fires at once (`weapons.tryFire()`, the disc flashes); the disc then captures the touch, so a
 *    drag from it turns the camera while the finger is held. With a MELEE weapon (the Driftwood swords, `MELEE`, polled
 *    from `weapons.current.id`, the layer carries `.melee`), holding it still (under HOLD_PX of travel) for HOLD_MS starts
 *    the heavy charge (`weapons.adsHeld = true`, the `.ws-touch-charge` ring fills with `weapons.current.charge`) and lifting
 *    releases the chop (`adsHeld = false`; Sword.ts queues an early release). Only a lift or a cancel ends the hold — no
 *    pointerleave, so a thumb rolling off the disc's edge keeps the charge. A fast tap-tap-tap stays a light combo: each
 *    tap lifts before HOLD_MS. With a ranged weapon the same disc reads FIRE (fire on down, drag = look, no hold).
 *  - iOS WebKit (E46, Jake's iPhone): the layer cancels its own touch events (non-passive touchstart / touchmove /
 *    touchend), pinch gestures, dragstart / contextmenu / selectstart, and marks every element draggable="false"; with
 *    touch.css's touch-action / user-select / touch-callout / user-drag none on every element that kills the double-tap
 *    zoom, the text selection / loupe / callout and the drag-lift ghost of a long-pressed button, which had stolen the
 *    ATTACK hold (the heavy never charged). Pointer events still fire. The listeners sit on the layer only, which is
 *    hidden while the title / menus are up, so their taps (the build pill, the cards) keep their clicks.
 *  - Every look surface turns at ONE rate: LOOK_RATE × `player.lookMult` (Settings Look / Swing turn speed) × aim-assist
 *    friction — the old 1.6× LOOK-pad boost is gone (E37 audit F6), so a swipe turns the same wherever it starts.
 *  - Right-thumb arc, just above the bar at the right edge: DODGE (lower-left) and JUMP (upper-right), one size, in a short
 *    even diagonal (E63's T feel; the V DODGE disc beside it was deleted in E82).
 *    It sets `player.touchDodge` → Player.dodge (toward the stick, a backstep with it centred) and
 *    hides while swimming. Its cooldown (`player.dodgeCooldown`, E59) shows as a dark clock sweep unwinding over the disc
 *    (--cd), a cyan flash when it is back (.ready), and a tap before then only shakes the disc (.deny). While the player swims (`player.onSwimChange`) JUMP gives its spot to DIVE, a HELD button
 *    (`player.touchDive` → `player.diveHeld`); once the eye is under (`player.submerged`, polled) SURFACE appears in
 *    DODGE's spot (`player.touchSurface`, hold to come up) and hides again on surfacing.
 *  - LOCK shows while a weapon that locks is held (`.lockable` — LockOnTarget's LOCK_WEAPONS: the swords, Nalati's sabre and
 *    spear, NALATI-MERGE H3) and there is something to lock (E319: a target in reach, or locked on — else `.lock-idle`
 *    hides it and its slot stays empty; a shard verb's hint keeps it up); in Nalati's saddle (`player.ride`, `.riding`) MOVE steers the horse, so it never reads ORBIT.
 *  - AIM (ranged kit only): the iron-sights toggle latch (`weapons.adsHeld`, tap on / tap off, lit `.on`) sits up-right of
 *    the FIRE disc, clear of the pill, left of DODGE, on the same thumb. Crossing between melee and ranged drops the latch, so a sword never
 *    comes up charging and a crossbow never comes up sighted.
 *  - Nalati's bow (`.bow`, NALATI-MERGE H4 / N18): FIRE reads "HOLD = DRAW" and is the draw — held = `weapons.altHeld`,
 *    its `.ws-touch-charge` ring fills with the draw and glows `.ready` at full; lifting at full looses (`.fire` flash),
 *    lifting early lets the arrow down (`.letdown`: no shot, the ring unwinds). A drag from it aims while drawing. AIM is
 *    the zoom toggle (the same `adsHeld` latch): down the arrow, tap again to come out. No quick-fire.
 *  - SWAP: the ring + pie on the left edge under HOVER (E303 / E319, every shard) — src/engine/ui/WeaponStrip.ts docks it into
 *    this layer.
 *  - HOVER (E80, Jake's pick C, art/hud/round-11-hover-position/C-bar-tab-above-move.jpg): a folder tab on the bar's top
 *    edge above the MOVE label, a toggle (`player.setHover`, mirrors the H key; lit `.on` while riding).
 *  - PAUSE top-left; under it the `?perf` frame meter, then a status column (`.ws-touch-status`) that the HUD (HUD.ts) fills
 *    with the VITALS strip and, on ranged kit, the BOLTS readout — out of the thumb lane. A shard's own rows, discs and
 *    tags dock into this layer through src/engine/ui/hudSlots.ts (E154: one base HUD on every shard, no per-shard layout).
 *  - USE: a big band above the right-thumb arc, shown only while the HUD has an interact prompt; it dispatches the same
 *    `KeyE` the keyboard path listens for. There is no RELOAD: `weapons.tryFire()` reloads an empty weapon itself.
 *
 * During a sword lunge (`meleeLock.lunging`, AimTargets.ts) the view eases onto the locked animal — `lungeTurn`, behind
 * the aim-assist switch. Aim assist (AimAssist.ts — friction / snap-on-AIM / tracking, touch only, pause-menu switch): the
 * layer owns an `AimAssist`, feeds it every look drag, runs it from `player.preUpdate` every frame and scales the drag by
 * `assist.lookScale()`.
 *
 * Lock-on (E50, src/engine/player/LockOnTarget.ts, project/archive/2026-09-23-lock-on.md): the LOCK disc (J — on the right-thumb arc up-left of DODGE,
 * melee only) toggles it; its states follow `lockOn.state` (off dim / available pulsing / LOCKED filled). While locked
 * every look drag (the LOOK side, the free-look area, a drag from ATTACK) is the ±10° glance that springs back, a FLICK on
 * the LOOK side (≥ 28 px at ≥ 600 px/s within 200 ms) switches target, the LOOK pad reads SWITCH ‹ ›, MOVE reads ORBIT
 * with an arc lit on the pushed side, and aim assist / the lunge turn stand down. A short tap on an enemy above the bar
 * locks it. A shard's traversal verb may re-dress LOCK and JUMP (`relabel()`, ShardManifest TouchRelabel, E286: Nine Dragon's
 * GRAPPLE / LOCKED / ZIP in the grapple's gold); every other shard keeps them as they are.
 * Talks to the player through `player.touchMove / touchSprint / touchJump / touchDodge / touchDive / touchSurface`
 * (analog, summed with WASD) and to the held weapon through the EquipmentService manager's `tryFire() / adsHeld / enabled / swap()`
 * (EquipmentService.ts). The layer only receives events once the intro is gone (`#hud.intro` hides it), and never needs pointer
 * lock — iOS has none.
