/**
 * A feature playground (E307): a standalone dev level for one shard's own verb, entered from the Explore hub the way the
 * Practice arena is (main.ts `enterPlayground`), with the shard's real code — Nine Dragon's Fei Zhua, Nalati's riding.
 *
 *   const pg = await loadPlayground('grapple', host)   // src/engine/practice/playground/load.ts: the scene's module on the tap
 *   pg.enter()        // built on first entry (its colliders registered then), the player put on its start
 *   pg.exit()         // pause ▸ Exit to Explore (or to the title): the room is hidden, the shard's own rules come back
 *
 * Like the Practice arena, a playground hangs high over the shard it belongs to — so high (PLAYGROUND_Y) that the whole
 * shard is past the camera's 2.6 km far plane and frustum-culled while you play: the scene draws only the playground.
 * It dispatches `ws:practice-active` (a practice room is up: no city grade, no drizzle, a depth-tested sun halo) and asks
 * mobile for 60 fps like the arena does (tier.ts practiceFps). That event is `practiceRoom.open` (src/engine/core/practiceRoom.ts):
 * the shard's open-world systems read it and step aside while you play (E321: no crouch / stealth off the grass 3 km under
 * you, no elites or night riders); the minimap draws the room's own `map`.
