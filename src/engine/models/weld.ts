/**
 * Welds (E347): a merge across several models' copies, owned by `place` (./place.ts `PlaceOptions.weld`). Site-fitted
 * buildings (Pine Hollow's homestead: its three log cabins and the mill hamlet's five buildings) hand `place` their parts
 * — geometry in the copy's frame, per material, each with its band — and the weld draws them:
 *
 *   unit 'copy'   each copy is its own unit: its parts merge into one mesh per material and band under its root, banded by
 *                 its distance; the meshes drawn at every distance are then welded ACROSS the copies into one mesh per
 *                 material (`WeldBatch`: drawn in a pass when any copy's share would be), each copy keeping a view of its
 *                 share (`WeldView`: its picking, its box, Explore's isolation) — the cabins: 1 draw per material, not 3
 *   unit 'whole'  every copy's parts merge into ONE set under the weld's root (its frame, banded by its distance + `pad`)
 *                 — the hamlet: five buildings cost about one cabin's draws
 *
 * Shadows (the log kit's, as data on the parts): a part's `depth` says how its depth reaches the shadow maps — through its
 * unit's position-only proxy for its band (`'proxy'`: one depth-only draw per band on SHADOW_LAYER, not one per material),
 * only through the near proxy (`'near'`), or its own mesh (none). A weld with `near` (the desktop tier) gives each 'copy'
 * unit one near proxy of everything it draws plus its copy's double-sided dressing (`casters`), drawn within the weld's
 * `detail` band, while the band proxies cast only past it: the same depth at every distance, one draw.
 *
 * Bands are data too: an object tagged `userData.until` (metres) is drawn only while the eye is nearer its copy (its unit,
 * + pad, for the unit's meshes), one tagged `userData.castFrom` casts only from that far (`WeldCull`, ./cull.ts): the
 * homestead's old per-building detail state machine (Cabins.update), as data.
 *
 * Copies placed instanced into a weld (`Placement.host`: the copy they stand about) are drawn by their host: one
 * InstancedMesh per part across the weld, holding the copies whose unit is within the weld's `detail` band (the props the
 * buildings set about). They cast no shadow of their own (the host's near proxy carries their depth).
