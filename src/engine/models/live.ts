/**
 * `listModel(model, options)` — a model whose copies a live system makes, not the world's layout (E306 / E315 M5): the
 * creatures the AnimalManager spawns and animates, the people a quest stands up, the gear the player holds, the arena's
 * training dummies. It registers the model's ONE catalog entry for the shard — the specimen built from the model in its
 * own space, its variants, its facts — and places no copies: the live system keeps drawing them exactly as it did (a
 * rigged creature is posed by its species' code, a weapon by its viewmodel, whose render queue and depth clear stay its
 * own). A shard lists its whole roster at boot (its species list: every creature it can spawn, alive right now or not —
 * the Captain, the Antler King, the flocks), so the Model Explorer always shows each one.
 *
 *   listModel(boar, { ctx, copies: () => animals.animals.filter((a) => a.kind === 'boar').length, drawnAs: 'skinned' });
 *   listModel(leverRifle, { ctx, copies: 1 });
 *
 * A model on the species rigs (`rig.species`) is stood up by the Explorer as an Animal of that kind, so its clip row
 * plays the species' gaits. A `shared/…` model (src/engine/models/) used by several shards says so on its card; `pipeline`
 * tells how THIS shard makes it when the model's own list covers them all (a boar: a lofted code rig on Driftwood, a
 * Hunyuan3D-2 hull on that rig in Pine Hollow).
