/**
 * The swimming hands (E348, the E315 M5 leftover): a shared model — the white-gloved forearms and mitten hands you see
 * while swimming on a shard without its own arm rig (Nalati's river, Pine Hollow's pond and creek; Driftwood swims in the
 * castaway's arms, its gear cards). The viewmodel (src/engine/player/Hands.ts) keeps drawing the pair at the water line, with
 * its own depth clear and render queue, and strokes them every frame; the card is a SEPARATE build by the same builder
 * (`buildSwimGloves`) on its own materials, standing in the tread pose (the hands out to the sides, the forearms aimed
 * from the elbows), lifted onto the turntable's disc. Variants: the smooth gloves every shard wears and the faceted ones
 * a low-poly shard would. One copy: the player's.
