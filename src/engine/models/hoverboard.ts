/**
 * The hoverboard (E348, the E315 M5 leftover): one shared model on every shard — the board the player rides in hover mode
 * (Player.hover, the H key / the HOVER tab): a rounded dark deck (0.9 × 0.28 m) with a cyan edge strip, a nose lamp and an
 * inlay, and two glowing repulsor discs underneath. The viewmodel (src/game/systems/tools/hoverboard.ts) keeps drawing the one you
 * ride — its own depth clear, render queue and pulsing glow; the card is a SEPARATE build by the same builder
 * (`buildHoverboard`) on its own materials, in the normal queue, so nothing the Explorer does reaches the board under you.
 * Listed on every shard (src/engine/models/roster.ts), one copy: the player's.
