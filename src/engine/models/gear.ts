 * The gear several shards' players hold (E306 / E315 M5, category `gear`), and what every shard's gear cards share.
 *
 *   shared/iron-sword  the iron sword (src/engine/player/Sword.ts `blade: 'iron'`): the wreck's loot on Driftwood, the second sword
 *                      (Nine Dragon's kit dropped it, E314 A: nothing there unlocks it).
 *
 * A weapon's viewmodel keeps its own render queue, depth clear, layers and materials; its card is the Explorer's specimen.
 * The specimen is a SEPARATE build by the weapon's own builder (`buildSword`, a shard's `buildRifleParts`: the functions the viewmodel
 * is built with, so the two never drift) on the specimen's own materials — opaque, in the normal queue, no depth clear —
 * so nothing the Explorer does (its turntable, its paint / wire views, a skin) reaches the weapon in your hands. A shard
 * lists its gear with `live(model, { copies: 1 })` (./live.ts): one copy per weapon its kit holds.
 *
 * Also here: a skinnable weapon's legendary skins as its variants (src/engine/player/Skins.ts: the same material overrides a
 * drop wears, applied to the specimen's own clones), a low-poly sword's card, and the wireframe box a specimen stands as
 * while its file loads.
