 * culling), carries the model's own-space colliders to every placement, registers ONE registry piece (what is drawn,
 * the world-space colliders, a floor) and the model's ONE catalog entry for the shard (copies summed over every
 * `place` of it, a tap target on its copies, VIEW IN WORLD on the real copy nearest the spawn).
 *
