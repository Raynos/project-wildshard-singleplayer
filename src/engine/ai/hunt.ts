/**
 * The hunting brain (SF72, E435): the herds' 10 Hz decisions that used to live inside AnimalManager — senses and the
 * awareness meter, alert / freeze, flee, the hunters' stalk, charges (the melee wind-up, the committed stretch, contact),
 * the E297 fight rules (attack tokens, back-off, the ring, `reengage`), herd panic, ambient calls, hit / stagger
 * reactions, wander goals with navmesh paths and the no-navmesh steering — plus the herd placement recipe.
 *
 * Renderer-free: it reads the world only through `HuntPorts` (ground, water, trees, navmesh, line of sight, the wander
 * goal) and speaks only through them (sounds, charge hits). The browser's AnimalManager wires the ports to the live
 * Heightfield / Forest / app and keeps blood, views and audio; a trusted Node host wires them to baked data. One shared
 * `Rng` (the manager's `Rng(SEED + 31)`) feeds placement, every spawn's rolls (`spawnRolls` then `adopt`) and every
 * decision, in exactly the order the browser always drew them.
 *
 * The hunting loop (DEER_TUNING / BOAR_TUNING below): every animal carries an `awareness` meter 0..1. It rises while the
 * player is inside the SIGHT cone or the HEARING radius and decays otherwise. At `alertAt` the head comes up and the
 * animal FREEZES staring at you (the shot window), then bolts if it still senses you (`boltAt`), or relaxes. It flees
 * only until `fleeUntil..fleeUntilMax` m away, then looks back and grazes again, "wary" for `waryTime` s. One spooked
 * animal alerts its herd within `herdAlertRadius` m. Chargers charge when hit or inside `chargeDist`; HUNTERS (a
 * HuntTuning with `stalk`) never bolt: the freeze ends in a STALK that becomes a charge inside panicDist.
