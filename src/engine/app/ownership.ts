 * through such a service (a quest card, a listener, a resource) then ends with the build, not with the page.
 *
 * Every method read through the facade runs under `withOwner(scope)`, with the real service as `this` (private fields
 * keep working). Plain data, class constructors and callables with their own `prototype` pass through untouched; nested
 * service objects are not wrapped (a facade is one level deep, by design: identity of nested objects is kept).
