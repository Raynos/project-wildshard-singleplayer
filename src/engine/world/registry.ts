/**
 * The world registry (PHYSICS.md P2b, ENGINE-FIT E1): one `add(piece)` per built thing, and everything that needs the
 * list of built things listens here instead of being wired by hand in main.ts — the scene, the physics world (the
 * piece's `ColliderDesc`s become Rapier colliders in src/engine/physics/pieces.ts), the player's floors while the P2 bridge
 * lasts, the ocean's foam rings — and Explore World (X10): a piece with `model` is a model in the Model Explorer's
 * catalog, and `models()` / `picks` are what src/engine/explore/registry.ts serves. One list: a built thing is registered once
 * and is drawn, collides and is explorable from that one `add`.
 *
 * E306 / E315 (project/archive/2026-09-30-model-architecture.md): models move onto the model contract, src/engine/models/model.ts. There
 * `place(model, placements, …)` makes the `add` — one piece per call, and the model's one catalog entry — and `sets`
 * holds the named groups of placements. A hand-written `model` on a piece is the old way; M6 removes it.
 *
 * `ColliderDesc` is engine-neutral data: builders emit it beside the geometry they draw and never import Rapier.
