/**
 * A camera's stand-in in a frame's own space (SHARD-PLATFORM SF63, E435). Content that culls against the view compares the
 * camera with data it measured in its own frame: placed copies' boxes (`place`), a herd's positions, a shard's tile rects.
 * Standalone that frame is the scene's. A grid region's content stands under its view root at the cell's render offset,
 * while the page camera is in the page's space, so the same test runs a whole offset away: copies beside the player
 * were dropped as out of range and out of view, and their shadows with them.
 *
 * `of(camera)` returns the camera itself while the frame's world matrix is the identity (standalone: the same object, the
 * same decisions), else this stand-in posed at the camera seen from the frame: its world matrix is the frame's inverse
 * times the camera's, with the camera's projection, field of view, zoom, aspect and clip planes. Posed once per `stamp`;
 * allocates nothing per call. Never rendered or parented: it only answers the questions a culler asks of a camera.
