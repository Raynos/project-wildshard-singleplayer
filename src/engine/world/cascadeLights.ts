/**
 * The sun's shadow cascades, as data a graph program can read (SHARD-PLATFORM SF59 step 2, fix 3;
 * sf59-tsl-spike.md §2.2). three's classic CSM is one DirectionalLight per cascade, and its shader chunk gates each light
 * to its own depth slice (with the fade margins); the shadow fade (shadowFade.ts, E147) mixes a ghost light's shadow into
 * cascade i's while a sun step crossfades. The sky rig registers its cascades here; a lit classic graph program takes
 * the same gate and fade through the set's `setup` (`graph/glslMaterial.ts` `gateCascades`). The TSL back-end that
 * first read this (NF18 retired it) gated each registered light the way the chunk does.
