/**
 * A second sky backdrop laid over a page's own by a weight (SHARD-PLATFORM G223, SF19a's one frame): a grid region whose
 * level's sky is a whole backdrop (a day clock driving a key dome, a PMREM environment, the lights, fog and haze), not
 * keys a region can hand over, draws that sky on the page's ONE sky rig while you are inside its cell, and blends it with
 * the page's own across the 16 m edge band.
 *
 * - **Its own targets**: the layered backdrop is bound to a private copy of the rig's targets (`SkyBackdropTargets`), so
 *   its clock writes only those. Each frame the page's own backdrop runs first and writes the shared state as always;
 *   then the layer runs its clock and moves every shared value it lights (the key light, the fill, the fog uniforms, the
 *   sun disc and halo, the cloud and far-haze uniforms, the environment intensity) toward its own by the weight; the
 *   environment texture swaps at half weight (a PMREM cube cannot be mixed). At the start of the next frame every value
 *   it moved is put back exactly before anything else runs, so the page's backdrop always finds its own state, and at
 *   weight 0 the shared state is the page's to the bit.
 * - **Its air**: given a fog object of its own (`air`, a grid region's fog: the one frame reads it as the owner's air and
 *   blends it by the owners' weights), the layer's clock writes its fog colour there and leaves the scene fog alone;
 *   without one it blends the scene fog's colour like the rest.
 * - **Its dome**: whatever the backdrop adds to the layer's `holder` scene (its sky dome) moves to the page scene (its
 *   `clouds` layer kept on the camera, as the page keeps its own), drawn
 *   after the page's own sky pieces (render order −20 … −10) and before the grid road sky (−9), its pieces in the order
 *   the backdrop draws them on its own (its opaque dome, then its cloud ring: `layerOrders`), depth-tested (the dome
 *   sits past every world thing), with a constant blend alpha of the weight; at weight 0 it is hidden and its clock is
 *   not run (no cost outside the cell).
 * - **Its own sky layer** (`SkyBackdrop.clouds`, SHARD-PLATFORM G321): a backdrop that hands its dome over as `clouds` (as
 *   standalone, where `SkyRig.build` attaches it to the page scene) has it joined to the holder at `attach`, so it is drawn
 *   like a dome it added itself. Kept on the camera, it is scaled out to at least `LAYER_DOME_REACH` of the camera's far
 *   plane: drawn depth-tested after the world (not first with no depth test, as a standalone dome may be), a 120 m dome
 *   would cover every world thing past 120 m. Its shading reads directions only, so the scale changes nothing it paints.
 * - **Its start** (G321): before the backdrop is built its targets take its level's own declared light (`seedLayerTargets`,
 *   as a standalone `SkyRig.build` starts from it), so a value its clock never writes (a fixed sky that only sets its key
 *   light) blends toward its own level's, never toward a copy of the page's light from when the layer was laid.
 * - **Its key light** (G321): a backdrop's `sky.setKeyLight` calls land on the layer's targets (`layerKeyedSky`), never
 *   straight on the page's shared light (where the blend then overwrote them with the layer's stale copy).
 * - **Its sun disc and halo**: hidden on its own targets (its look's `sky.sun` off, or its clock hiding them), the page's
 *   are hidden from half weight on, like the environment swap.
 * - **Its world-anchored sky pieces** (`SkyBackdrop.dressing`, G321: a cloud sea, cloud puffs, a sun glow): drawn in the
 *   page scene in its level's own frame at its region's origin (`origin`): their programs read the view and the camera
 *   shifted by the origin (`wsLayerView`, `wsLayerOrigin`), so a piece that reads world positions in its shader (a puff
 *   billboarded on its own attribute, a sea wound round a fixed point) draws exactly as standalone; each one's output is
 *   faded by the weight (`wsLayerFade`: its alpha, or its whole colour where it blends `One`), and the pieces keep their
 *   own render order and blending. Hidden, and not drawn, at weight 0.
 * - **Its dispose**: the dome leaves the page scene, the backdrop's own `dispose` frees its textures and targets, and the
 *   last frame's moved values go back at the next update.
 *
 * The post effects a backdrop drives (`attachPost`) stay the page's: a layered backdrop is never handed them.
 *
 * **A base layer** (SHARD-PLATFORM G242, `base: true`): a sky that stands in for the page's own backdrop by its weight (the
 * grid road's dome and key light, outside every cell). It is applied first, before every other layer, and its dome is drawn
 * under theirs (`BASE_SKY_ORDER`), at a weight taken from the share the other layers leave (`applyLayers`): its weight `w`
 * becomes `w / (1 − S)`, `S` the other layers' weights, capped at 1. With the owners' weights summing to 1 (a grid frame), the
 * shared state and the drawn sky are then exactly `w · base + Σ wᵢ · layerᵢ + (1 − w − S) · page`: across a cell's edge band
 * the road blends straight into the region's own sky, with nothing of the page's showing through. At weight 0 it is off
 * like any layer, so inside a cell the page and the region's layer are exactly what they were without it.
