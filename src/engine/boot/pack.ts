/**
 * The boot pack (scripts/bake-packs.mjs; project/archive/2026-09-22-load-perf.md "requests, first launch ≤ 20"): this shard's boot
 * files for this tier, concatenated in step order into a few content-addressed parts (E160: one file per pack meant any
 * edit re-downloaded all of it). `streamPack` fetches the parts one after another and cuts each into its files as the
 * bytes land; the first file is ready after its own bytes, not after the pack's.
 *
 * Nothing downstream changes: the steps still `fetch()` their files by name (fetchImage, three's FileLoader /
 * ImageBitmapLoader, the baked-terrain reader), and a GET of a packed path is answered with that file's bytes from
 * the pack — waiting for them when they have not landed yet. Loaders that bypass fetch (Safari's GLTFLoader loads
 * textures through <img>) are handed a blob: URL through the loading manager once the file is in; the pack puts glTF
 * textures ahead of their .gltf (and never cuts a part between them) so that is always the case by the time the model asks.
 *
 * The DOWNLOAD track is credited here as the pack streams (per file, to the source that declared it), since the
 * byte counter's fetch tee never sees the packed paths. A part that fails to arrive (404 on a stale deploy, offline
 * with an empty cache) is not fatal: every packed path still waiting falls back to its own request.
 *
 * A part fetched before a worker controls the page publishes its complete native
 * response into the same immutable URL cache. No claim deadline or worker RPC
 * stands between its completion and a durable warm/offline read.
 *
 * Headless per-file record runs exercise the same unavailable-part fallback with a fetch adapter.
