/**
 * The app's asset tables (E405 E415): every shipped file's size and content hash, the music and sound-effect
 * manifests, and each level's boot pack. They list the game's own files (every shard's folders), so they are the
 * game's: vite/gen.ts and scripts/bake-packs.mjs write them to src/game/boot/*.generated.ts, and src/identity.ts
 * installs them with the app identity before any other module runs (a Node bake gets them through
 * scripts/bake-loader.mjs). The engine reads them through these accessors, never by importing a table.
 *
 * Like the identity, they sit in one global slot, so a test that resets its modules still sees them; nothing has a
 * default (an empty table would make every declared boot file look missing).
