/**
 * DL21: a boot that stops moving gets a named way out instead of a silent dead card. The composition root
 * (src/entry.ts `start`) watches its selected-shard start with `watchStuckStep`: the loading card's progress (its step,
 * setup share and bytes read, `progressOfCard`) is read every second, and once none of it has moved for `boundMs` the
 * watch calls `stalled` once with the step it is stuck on (the root opens the fatal modal, whose RELOAD HERE is the retry
 * under the shared reload budget, src/engine/core/reloadGuard.ts). A settled start, either way, ends the watch; a start
 * that throws names the step it died on (`stuckMessage`).
