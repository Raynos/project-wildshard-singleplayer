 *  process has them compiled before the Shaders step asks. Default ON since the throttled Simulator pair (11-04, 4a7a88b,
 *  10 Mb/s + 100 ms, off -> on): cold tap -> control Nine 47.3 -> 40.7 s, Driftwood 36.0 -> 27.0 s; the row stays as the
 *  off switch until Jake's iPhone confirms it (a rendering change waits for a physical-device reading).
 *  The pass that issued the spawn view's programs at the end of the world build is gone (sp-o1, 11-04): it compiled
 *  before the level's point lights were placed, so lit programs came out with the wrong light count (Driftwood's
 *  ground: 0 point lights instead of 3, links the level never draws, ~0.55 s each on the Simulator), and the baked list
 *  already warms every program the entry draws. A reload row: the first read of a page is its value. */
