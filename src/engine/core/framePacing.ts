/**
 * Frame pacing for builds that run while the game is drawing (op-hitch26, E435 frame floor, G294).
 *
 * A grid cell admits its world on the road, in play: every synchronous stretch of a builder lands between two drawn frames.
 * The engine's loop reports each frame it draws (`noteFrameDrawn`); while it keeps drawing, the page is *presenting*, and a
 * sliced build ends a stretch with `paceYield()`: a plain macrotask while the next frame is not yet due, or — when it is —
 * a wait until the loop has drawn one. A timer or message hop alone does not guarantee that: Blink may run several queued
 * tasks back to back before its rendering update (measured on Nine Dragon's cell entry, op-hitch23 / op-hitch26).
 *
 * Not presenting (the loading screen, a frozen title, Node bakers and tests): nothing changes, every yield is the caller's
 * own macrotask and `presenting()` is false, so a loader keeps its own budgets. Quiet frame floors back pacing on by default.
 * Pacing follows the loop's recent drawn frames; importing this module does not draw or schedule a frame.
