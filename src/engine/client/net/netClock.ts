// P1-E5.3-F3 (E5-REPLICATION §6.1, J51): where the server is now, as this client can tell, and how far behind it to draw.
// The server's time comes from frame ticks through a slow PLL that nudges by at most ±1 %, so jitter on the wire never reaches
// the screen as jitter in the clock. A frame is stamped where it arrives (`onmessage`), never in a render frame: at Low Power
// Mode's 24.3 frames/s a render stamp would add 41 ms of jitter that isn't there (J121).
