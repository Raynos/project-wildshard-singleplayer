/**
 * Worn cosmetics (E314, project/archive/2026-09-30-driftwood-loot.md: the Drowned Captain's hat and the sailcloth cape, GEAR cosmetics
 * worn or taken off from the Bag). The game is first person and the player has no body mesh, so a worn thing shows
 * where a body would: in the player's SHADOW on the sand (board 4 C). `Wardrobe` hangs each worn model on its socket
 * on a root that follows the player's feet and yaw; in the default `shadow` mode its meshes draw nothing to the screen
 * (colour and depth writes off: one empty draw each) and cast their shadow as themselves — a swaying model keeps its
 * sway depth material, so the cape's shadow moves with the wind. `visible` mode draws them as they are (a mirror, a
 * third-person camera, the Bag's paper doll).
 *
 * First person: the hat's brim sits just above the eye and the cape behind the shoulders, so neither is ever in the
 * view in `shadow` mode, and nothing clips the camera. Shard-agnostic: the models come in as built objects (a shard's
 * `buildCaptainHat` / `buildSailclothCape`), each in its own space as the model contract has it.
 *
 *   const wardrobe = new Wardrobe();            scene.add(wardrobe.root);
 *   wardrobe.wear('hat', buildCaptainHat(ctx));  wardrobe.wear('cape', null);   // take the cape off
 *   // each frame, after the player moves:
 *   wardrobe.follow(player.position.x, player.position.y, player.position.z, player.yaw);
 *
 * Worn on the player's body shadow (src/engine/player/BodyShadow.ts, E314 stage 3): its `wardrobe` follows the invisible castaway,
 * and Driftwood's keepsakes (src/shards/driftwood-isle/loot/keepsakes.ts) dress it from the Owned store's worn cosmetics.
