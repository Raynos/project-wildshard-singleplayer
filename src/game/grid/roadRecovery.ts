 * Road respawn (SHARD-PLATFORM SF17b, G101): *"If you fall to your death you spawn at the road not inside the shard."*
 * The live crossing remembers the last place the traveller stood on the road itself (the 15 m asphalt band of a segment,
 * not the strips beside it). A fall that began from the road (no ground under the feet inside a cell since) recovers
 * there, in a lane, whatever frame the traveller fell into. Recovery belongs to a cell after a grounded entry through
 * its declared opening, or five continuous seconds grounded at least twenty metres inside its edge (G127 / G129).
 *
 * Pure grid metres, no three.js or physics: the caller feeds it the world feet once per fixed step.
