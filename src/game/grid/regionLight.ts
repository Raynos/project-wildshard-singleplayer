/**
 * A live region's light on the page's one sky (SHARD-PLATFORM G223 / SF48-g, E435). There is one sun, one fill, one
 * sky rig, one set of fog and painterly uniforms and one colour chain on a grid page (SF19a). A trusted runtime admitted
 * as a neighbour region lights them the way it lights its own standalone page: its day clock, weather and look rig write
 * the key light, the fill, the sun disc, the shadow maps, the painterly and fog uniforms, the volumetric light and the
 * engine grade every frame, and a few of those once at build.
 *
 * Honest per value:
 * - **its air and grade** already reach the one frame through `frameLook.ts` (its own fog object, its level's grade);
 * - **everything else it lights** is a region-scoped override of the shared state: held when the region is entered, put
 *   back exactly when it is left (so the road, or the next cell, finds the page as it was), and the region's own values
 *   come back on its next entry (its once-at-build writes, such as a phone shadow map size, survive the round trip).
 *   The override swaps at the interior crossing; it is not blended across the 16 m edge band (only the air and grade are).
 *
 * The painterly clock `uPTime` is a clock, not a look, and keeps running. Generic game code (E405): no shard is named here.
