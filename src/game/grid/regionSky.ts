/**
 * A live grid region's own sky inside its cell (SHARD-PLATFORM G223; the only path since Jake's G232 pick, SF63). A region whose level's look declares a sky backdrop (a day
 * clock driving a key dome, a PMREM environment and the lights, fog and haze: `LookStrategy.backdrop`) has that backdrop
 * built a second time on the page's ONE sky rig as a layer (`SkyRig.layerBackdrop`, `backdropLayer.ts`): its own targets,
 * its dome drawn over the page's sky, its clock blended into the shared light by its cell's owner weight from the one frame
 * (1 inside the cell, blended across the 16 m edge band, 0 on the road, where nothing of it is run or drawn). Its fog
 * colour goes to the region's own fog object, which the frame already reads as the owner's air (`frameLook.ts`).
 *
 * Memory, charged honestly: once built, the backdrop's ceiling (its resident key cap at the decoded size, the environment
 * equirect and PMREM's cube-UV targets: `SkyBackdrop.gpuCeiling`) is reserved through the page allocator under the
 * region's owner (`sim-sky:<instance>`, needed while resident); a refusal disposes it and the grid sky stays.
 * A reviewed matched runtime increment already contains its own sky: the exact child claim stays visible as a page
 * component covered by that instance's measured sim lease, with no engine-base credit. If that parent ends first, the
 * sky is independently charged again. Estimates and other instances cannot provide this coverage.
 * The build itself runs before the claim (the ceiling is only known once the first keys decode). Everything is freed with
 * the region's resident scope: the frame weight, the layer (its dome leaves the page scene, the rig puts every shared
 * value back), the backdrop's textures and targets (`SkyBackdrop.dispose`), then the claim.
 *
 * The level's grade chain (its LUT, curve and vibrance with the rest) is the frame's (`frame.ts`, G232): the drawn backdrop's
 * LUT is the one the region hands it, and its clock's saturation drives the page's where the page carries it. Generic game code
 * (E405): no shard is named here; the regional world closes over the page sky, renderer and level (`regionalWorld.ts`).
