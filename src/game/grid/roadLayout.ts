/**
 * The boulevard's layout (SHARD-PLATFORM SF17b look, G80 / G81 / G89 / G93): where the roads, junctions, turn-ins,
 * streetlights and distance signs of the grid's deck sit, as plain data in grid metres. No three.js here, so the layout
 * is testable in Node; `roadLook.ts` draws it and `voidLook.ts` draws the void past the outer road.
 *
 * The deck's shape is the generator's (`@wildshard/engine/sim/strips`): between two cells a 55 m gap, a 15 m road on the
 * gap's centre line and a 20 m strip each side; a junction where four gaps meet. The outer ring is the gap past the
 * outermost cells, and the rail (the void's collision wall) sits on its outer shoulder.
 *
 * Every road segment between two junctions has one turn-in at its midpoint (G93: a shard's four entryways sit at its edge
 * midpoints), so the kerb opens there on each side that has a cell. Sign text is a cell's shard name from the catalogue's
 * slug, never a name written here; an open plot's side (G198) has its turn-in too, signed with the strings table's plot name.
