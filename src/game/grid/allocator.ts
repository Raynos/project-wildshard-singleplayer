/**
 * The one residency allocator (SHARD-PLATFORM SF18b, A18): every resident thing the grid keeps (render tiles and far
 * proxies, shard libraries, the commons, whole sims) is charged here through the SF22a cost model
 * (`@wildshard/engine/core/contentCost`) against the §3.2 playing envelope. Owners: the render rings reserve `l0` / `l1` /
 * `far`, the grid simulation registry reserves `sim:`, the shardfile loader reserves `library:` and `commons:`.
 *
 * Admission is synchronous. A claim that does not fit evicts unneeded, unheld claims farthest-first (ties by id, so the
 * same drive evicts the same things) in two phases: each candidate's owner prepares its eviction (the fallible part, such
 * as a sim's durable checkpoint) until the prepared bytes cover the shortfall; then every prepared eviction commits before
 * its claim is removed. A failed disposal keeps its charge and aborts the remaining preparations. If they never cover it,
 * every prepared eviction aborts and nothing is evicted. G556: the envelope is only
 * the eviction target; the limits are per shard, so the claim is then judged by its owner alone ({@link shardCost}) and
 * refused only when that owner is over them (the caller keeps what it has: a coarse tile, a soft wall). `needed` claims are never even prepared. An id already held is
 * shared (refcount), so a dependency used by several shards is charged once. Node-safe: no rendering, no timers.
