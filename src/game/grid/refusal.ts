 * Why a shard can't load (SHARD-PLATFORM SF58 (12), G167): a cell whose shard is refused (by memory admission, a
 * validation / safety failure, a format it can't read or a load error) keeps its soft wall closed and shows G217's cell
 * screen (`cellScreen.ts`: the full Developer loading screen, the reason in amber, YOUR SAVE IS KEPT); SHARD SELECT shows
 * that shard's **UNAVAILABLE card**.
 *
 * This module is the pure part: `classifyRefusal` maps the thrown admission error to a reason (or null: a cell that is only
 * waiting for M3, or a page tearing down, is not refused), `refusalReason` words it, and `ShardRefusals` remembers this
 * session's refused slugs for SHARD SELECT.
