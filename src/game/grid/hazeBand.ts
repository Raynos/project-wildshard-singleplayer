/**
 * A shard's haze band under the one frame (SHARD-PLATFORM SF19b, G94 / G95): a shard that declares a `band` in its far
 * look (Signal Dunes' warm dusk dust) shows its mood from the road through a tall band of its own haze rising from the
 * strip at its border, never a second sky. Drawn wherever the grid builds its one frame (G175). Under G158 the band
 * is the outside half of the shard's mood: on the road the neutral road look owns the frame, so the band is what reads
 * as Signal Dunes' dusk from there; once the player crosses its cell edge Signal Dunes owns the whole frame (its
 * declared air and grade, `frame.ts`) and the band is the dust wall it walked through.
 *
 * One draw per banded shard: a curtain quad on each of the cell's four edges, out at the kerb, unlit, dense at the
 * ground and thinning upward in soft vertical wisps, faded out near the camera so a traveller walks through it. It blends
 * colour only and keeps the destination alpha (a level may keep data there; the frame no longer reads it).
