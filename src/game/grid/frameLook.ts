/**
 * A live region's part in the one grid frame (SHARD-PLATFORM SF19a / G175, M3 / E452): what an admitted neighbour runtime
 * brings as its cell's owner, beside the look its far proxy declared.
 *
 * - **Its air**: the region's own fog object (`scene.fog` of its scene subtree). Its runtime's weather and scripted rooms
 *   write that fog's colour as they do standalone (a boss seal darkening it, rain greying it); the frame reads what was
 *   written as the owner's air before the scene draws, blends it by the owner's weight like any owner's air, and then
 *   writes the base (the owner's declared haze, else the home air) back, so the next frame's writes start from the base.
 *   There is still one fog, one sky dome and one sun: the region's fog object is never drawn itself.
 * - **Its grade**: the region level's own grade (`regionGrade`), which replaces the far proxy's declared grade (or the
 *   neutral one) while the region is resident.
 * - **Its whole grade chain** (G232, `regionChain`): on a page whose own grade is a neutral shell (G226's owned home), the
 *   region's level grade is carried exactly as a standalone boot of that level applies it: the page's engine grade
 *   effects (saturation, brightness and contrast, the split tone) take the level's values and its look layer's S-curve and
 *   vibrance, then its learned LUT, all faded with the cell's owner weight; its runtime and its sky's clock then drive
 *   those effects as they do standalone (`post`). The uniform grade then stays neutral for it.
 *
 * The frame binds its port to the page's root scene (`bindFrameLook`), and a region looks it up from the scene it draws
 * into (`frameLookOf`), so no layer names the other. Generic game code (E405): no shard is named here.
