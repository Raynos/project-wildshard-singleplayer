/**
 * One frame for the grid (SHARD-PLATFORM SF19a, re-aimed by G158), the pure model: who owns the frame where the player
 * stands, and how the owners' looks blend across the cell edge. Node-safe; no three.js.
 *
 * - **The owner** (G158, Jake: "once you enter a shard, that shard has a lot of control over the graphics … once you
 *   leave a shard, it goes back to the neutral no man's road network's art style"): inside a cell its shard owns the
 *   whole frame (its sky, sun, air, exposure and grade apply to everything on screen, neighbours included); on the road
 *   and strips the neutral road look does. There is no per-pixel region any more: one look per frame.
 * - **The blend**: the owner changes at the cell edge (§3.3's crossing line, the 500 m cell boundary). A cell's weight
 *   is 1 more than `band / 2` inside its edge, 0 more than `band / 2` outside it, and a smoothstep across the band
 *   between (`FRAME_BAND`, 16 m centred on the line). It is a pure function of position, so standing on the line holds
 *   a steady half-and-half blend and never flickers. The strip is 55 m wide, so two cells never share a frame: the road
 *   look holds the whole deck (the road band is 20–35 m out).
 * - **Time**: one world clock; an owner may declare a fixed time of day, blended in by its weight along the shortest
 *   way round the day.
