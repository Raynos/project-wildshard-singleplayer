 * you come near, sways a little as it talks, eases a talk and a point clip in and out on the rig (the point toward one
 * spot, now and then while talking), walks to a spot on request (its collider and talk point go along), and draws inside
 * a distance, casting a shadow inside a nearer one. Every number is the shard's row; the shard passes the geometry, the
 * materials and the rig source.
