/**
 * Creature rewards are persistent player data, independent of a world continuation. E7 supplies this from each
 * authenticated player's OwnedSlots/PlayerDoc and flushes changes through its durable player-save path.
 *
 * NetWorld.identified binds a seat on hello and room handoff. The local worker accepts its device hello, while E7
 * must bind the verified session identity, reject a hello that changes it, and clear the binding when a seat is released.
 * Reconnect, another seat, room handoff, process restart and empty-cell retirement must keep the same player record.
 * The default local store and legacy shard-wide fallback are not dedicated-server identity or persistence services.
 *
 * Local workers write device-keyed creature-rewards on every kill/claim. Only the first local device inherits old
 * shard-wide saves and the old lead reward continuation. Old non-lead seat-only rows have no proven device binding;
 * migrating those on E7 requires a verified historical mapping, never the current occupant of the former seat.
 * syncPageRewards reconciles current cosmetics/discovery across localStorage and IndexedDB before boot; the
 * dedicated adapter instead reads its authoritative player document. J105 pays every meaningful contributor.
