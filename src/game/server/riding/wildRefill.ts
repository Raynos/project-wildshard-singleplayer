/**
 * J108, J109 on a bonded-mount world: the place a tamed stallion left in a room's wild fills again on the refill's timer,
 * sooner with more players near it and never in front of one. The body that left the wild is the one that returns: it
 * stands hidden for the whole wait, so a return costs the shard's budget nothing.
 *
 * It sweeps the hidden stallions rather than listening for `creature.tamed`, so a horse tamed alone still comes back once a
 * second player joins and that player has a wild one to tame. One player's pasture stays empty and their save never gains
 * this row.
