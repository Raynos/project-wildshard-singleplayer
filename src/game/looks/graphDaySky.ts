/**
 * A day sky drawn on material graphs, as a backdrop (SHARD-PLATFORM W2 C2; Pine Hollow's keyed sky and Driftwood's
 * faceted day): the lifecycle every graph day sky shares, so a shard writes only its sky and its clock's frame.
 *
 * THE HOST compiles the sky's graphs from the shard's look catalogue on the page renderer (they leave with the backdrop's
 * owner), preloads the baked textures and the level's LUT beside them, adds the dome to the scene (the background off),
 * owns the image-based light (`SkyEnvironment`: the source PMREM'd in place, refreshed on its timer; a scene source may
 * build its first environment offscreen), runs the clock (`onSet`: wait for what the phase needs, snap every knob, redraw
 * the environment), keeps the dome on the camera when asked, and frees the dome, the environment pass and the environment
 * when the backdrop leaves (a grid region's layered sky, G223), reporting their GPU bytes.
 *
 * THE DOME is a row (`dome`: its graph, radius and segments, draw order): one back-faced sphere, no depth test, untouched by
 * the material's tone map (the post chain grades it), built by the host and handed to `build`.
 *
 * THE CHANNELS (`channels`, H4): the shard's declared numeric channel group (`clientChannels` rows,
 * `@wildshard/game/plugin/channelPrograms`) is the sky's frame as data. From `bind` on, after the shard's `drive`, the host
 * fills the `clock` owner (`phase`, `day` 1 / 0, `night`, `sunX…Z`, `moonX…Z`), evaluates the group over it, the shard's
 * own numeric owners (`owners`: its blended preset, its uniforms) and the backdrop's targets (`sky.fog` `{ color }`,
 * `sky.fogSun`, `sky.disc` (its transform), `sky.discColour` `{ color }`, `sky.planetSun`, `sky.planetHaze`), then pushes
 * every graph param an output names (target = a sky graph id, path `[param]` or `[param, x|y|z|w]`) through `setParam`.
 *
 * THE SHARD builds its sky from the compiled graphs and the dome (`build`): its environment source, its running clock
 * (`runDayClock`), its frame (`drive`: what the channels don't turn, from `bind` on, `snap` at a jump) and whatever it holds
 * beyond them (decoded keys: `prepare`, `bytes`, `ceiling`, `rebuild`, `dispose`). Nothing here knows a shard or its sky.
 *
