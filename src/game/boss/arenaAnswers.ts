/**
 * The open arena encounter's answers, renderer-free (CI12: the Nalati chapter tape plays the Storm Titan's tie and clear on

 * boundary answer (the tie prompt's reach and label, a disarm, where the player is held, a wall hit, and the clear: calm
 * weather, then the kill and the feat recorded). `ArenaRoomEncounter` (arenaRoom.ts) applies them through these, in this
 * order; a native host passes its own boss, player, weather and persistence.
