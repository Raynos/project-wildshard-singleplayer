 * A phased boss fight (SHARD-PLATFORM SF27): the richer sibling of `markedBossFight`. One body fought through declared
 * phases; a declared state machine of modes (each with its damage rule, its hp lock, its motion and its timed beats);
 * attack patterns as strike rows (a cut combo, a charged burst, a roar); invulnerability windows; adds that step out in
 * waves while the boss is shielded; arena hazards (expanding rings, timed pours, a sweeping beam); and named VIEW
 * bindings (`arena.lid.open`, `hazard.sweep`, …) the shard binds to its own view code. The fight's logic is platform and
 * view-free; the shard keeps its rows, its arena (floor heights, drifts) and its views.
 *
 * Other bosses fit the same table: a mode per stance, a strike row per attack, a hazard per arena trick, a view per
 * dressing change.
