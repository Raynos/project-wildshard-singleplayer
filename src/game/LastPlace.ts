/**
 * LastPlace — where a death puts you back on a shard with named places (E295, DRIFTWOOD-TOP10 row 4): the LAST NAMED
 * PLACE YOU REACHED, not the spawn. Walking into a place's radius is what discovers it (quest/core.ts
 * `placesWithDiscovery`), so the newest discovery is always the checkpoint; walking back into an older one (already
 * discovered) makes that one the checkpoint again, so you come back near where you were, not across the island.
 *
 * The point you come back to is where YOU stood: the first walkable footing inside the place after you entered it (on
 * the ground or a registry floor, not swimming, not wading, not on the board / the zipline / a horse — main.ts decides
 * `grounded` with the physics `floorBelow`). A place's centre can be the sea, a roof or a cliff face; your own footing
 * never is. You face into the place. No place reached yet → null, and the caller uses the shard's spawn.
 *
 *   const last = new LastPlace(() => places.points);
 *   last.observe({ x, y, z, grounded });     // a few times a second, not while dying
 *   last.stand                                // { id, label, x, y, z, yaw } | null
 *   last.reset()                              // "Exit to main menu" → ENTER WORLD starts over at the spawn
