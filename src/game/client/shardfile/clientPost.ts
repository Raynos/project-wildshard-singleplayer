/**
 * A shard's own post stack on the client (SHARD-PLATFORM SF59 step 4, G158): the admitted `look.post` passes compiled by the
 * classic graph back-end into composer passes (`ScenePostGraphCompiler.compilePass`, plus one normal pre-pass when a pass
 * reads `sceneNormal`), inserted before the engine's colour pass (so the platform's grade, tone mapping and anti-aliasing
 * still run after them) and removed with the scope.
 *
 * - **Default off:** the stack is built only while Settings ▸ Debug ▸ Look ▸ "Graph materials" is on (the row the graph
 *   materials already wait behind for a physical-iPhone reading); otherwise nothing loads and the frame is unchanged.
 * - **The owner weight:** `weight(w)` fades every pass over the scene (0 disables them, so a stack outside its cell costs
 *   nothing); standalone it stays 1, in the grid the frame hands it its cell's owner weight.
 * - **Bound params move:** a pass's day and state bindings are fed like the material graphs' (`graphParamFeeds`): the
 *   frame owner's hour samples the shard's own look keys, a state binding reads the live public state (the field's
 *   declared default until `bind` hands the source); `tick` moves them each frame.
