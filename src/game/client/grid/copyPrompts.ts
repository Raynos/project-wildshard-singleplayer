/**
 * A template copy's "[E] …" prompts inside the grid (SHARD-PLATFORM template-prompts, E435). Standalone, a shardfile
 * shard's declared interactions (`targets.interactions`: the template's hut door) become the page runtime's prompts
 * (`installDeclaredTargets`). In the grid every copy is a region of the server's, so the same rows become that region's
 * prompts here: in its frame (the source's own coordinates are frame-local), and each press goes to the server by its row,
 * which runs the scene. The page offers them only while the feet stand in the entered copy (`enteredCopy`), and they go
 * with the region (built at admission, dropped at its disposal).
 *
 * Not here: an item scene (`targets.itemActions`, the template's lantern toggle / refill) is the held item's own action;
 * a template cell holds its empty equipment (bare hands, G68), so no prompt can reach an item runtime there.
