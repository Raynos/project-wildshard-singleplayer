/**
 * A model drawn from a shard's whole-geometry library (SHARD-PLATFORM W2): a baked, site-fitted or authored piece whose
 * parts are named geometries the shard already read (`readWholeGeometry`, `@wildshard/game/plugin/geometry`), each on a
 * material the shard names by key, merged by the engine's weld unit (`UnitParts`: one mesh per material and band, the
 * position-only shadow proxies of its `'proxy'` parts). It is the `build` and `colliders` of an ordinary model, so
 * `place` draws, registers and lists it (its Explorer card, its floors and colliders) like any other:
 *
 *   export const pier = defineModel({ id: '<slug>/pier', …, ...libraryModel({ draws, geometry, material, colliders }) });
 *
 * `draws` gives a copy's parts by its params, `geometry` a fresh geometry for a library name (`D`: a shard's own table's
 * keys, or any string; the unit merges it),
 * `material` the material for a key, `colliders` (optional) the copy's own-space colliders, `finish` (optional) tags the drawn
 * meshes and proxies (a shard's distance bands, a tier's shadows) before `place` takes them, and `loading` (optional) is
 * for a library that may load after a copy is asked for (an Explorer card opened before the shard's world hook): the
 * model `prepare`s by its `load`, and until `ready()` a copy is a loading specimen about `size` big that fills once it
 * resolves. A copy's draws are asked for at once, so params that name no library piece throw before any load.
