/**
 * What a kill is worth in doubloons (E314 L1, Jake's pick board 1 A): coins come only from kills, and only on a shard
 * whose ShardManifest says `loot: { coins: true }` (Driftwood today). First-guess values, tuned after a playthrough (a run
 * earns ~60–100; the trader's goods cost 15–50, project/archive/2026-09-30-driftwood-loot.md). No deer: Jake cut them from Driftwood
 * (their removal is a later pass), so they pay nothing meanwhile.
 *
 *   coinsFor(chunk, a.kind)   → 0 on a shard without coins, or a creature that pays nothing
 *   burstCount(n)             → how many coin meshes fly (a big purse is split over fewer coins)
