/**
 * Where a page load goes (the composition root's first decision, src/entry.ts): the renderer-free title, or a level.
 * Pure, so it is tested as a function (test/navigation-arrival.test.ts) rather than by mocking the entry's imports (E422).
 *
 * Safari may reload the same document after WebContent dies: when the previous page ended abruptly while booting the
 * level this URL asks for again, the load is rescued to the title until the player chooses a level again.
 * A URL with only version or environment harness settings is the title too; those settings do not select a level.
