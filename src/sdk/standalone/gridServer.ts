// P1-E3.9, E5.2b: the grid in the server worker. One world steps at a time and each keeps its own clock and room, as the MMO's
// will; a crossing hands the client over with `travel`. It reads `simulation.ts`, `room.ts` and `roomNet.ts`, never
// `LiveGridHost`, whose ports are the page's.
//
// The boot decision: a grid session starts with its owner on the road, because `GridSimulation` is built around a highway host
// whose lead holds a motor, and `enter` then moves that lead into the home cell before the first tick. So a fresh boot, a
// restored cell and a save made on the road all take one path. The road and each cell's seams are the page's own strips, from
// C2's grid pack, held near the player the way a native cell's solids are, so no save carries them.
