/**
 * D74: every inline material graph of an authored declaration becomes a content-addressed JSON file of its library
 * closure, and its catalogue entry `{ family: 'graph', file: <hash> }`. Graphs were most of a declaration's JSON nodes
 * (Nalati's 28 held 38,093 of the 100,000), and a file is charged by its bytes, not its nodes. One path for every shard:
 * the file's row names the graph's texture params as its dependencies (so they stay in the closure, as the inline graph's
 * did), identical graphs share one file, and the files' bytes join the build's owned assets. A declaration without a
 * look catalogue is returned as it is.
