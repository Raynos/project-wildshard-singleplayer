 * History (E46 → E58): an iOS home-screen web app laid out UNDER the status bar (`viewport-fit=cover` + black-translucent)
 * had WebKit shrink the viewport a status bar short (~62 px) about a second after load, and keep it short; the black strip
 * sat under the control bar and the title. E46 papered over it here by sizing to `screen.height`, but WebKit clips fixed
 * content to the shrunk viewport, so the strip stayed (and the bar was cut). Bisected in the iOS 26.5 simulator's
 * home-screen app (E58): `overflow: hidden` on html / body and the boot loader's relayout both trigger the shrink, and only
 * dropping `viewport-fit=cover` (the page starts below the status bar and runs to the bottom edge) cures it for good. So
 * this is plain innerHeight again; the module stays as the one place to change should WebKit need another workaround.
