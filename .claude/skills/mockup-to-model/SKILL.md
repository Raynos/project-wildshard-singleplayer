name: mockup-to-model
description: Make one Wildshard model (a prop, building, rock, plant, creature, NPC or weapon) from a mockup or reference image, end to end. Covers the mockup in the game's own frame, a reference sheet with a detail list, picking the pipeline (three.js code, TRELLIS.2, Hunyuan3D-2, a Blender script or CC0), building it, LODs and phone tiers, registering it for physics and the Model Explorer, self-review, and Jake's portrait board or spin clip. Use it when asked to "model", "add", "replace", "remaster" or "generate" a thing in a shard, or to turn an image into a three.js model. Not for an area's overall look (docs/design/LOOK-LOOP.md), a shard slice (shard-checkpoints), render bugs or HUD work.

# Mockup to model

One model, from a picture to a registered, reviewed, shipped thing. This is the workflow the game's shipped models
were made with (docs/audits/models-and-model-explorer.md §2), written down once (E315, M11). The reasons behind it are
in `docs/design/image-to-threejs-review.md` and `docs/design/blender-practice.md`.

A **model** is one reusable thing built by exactly one builder, in its own space: metres, +Y up, pivot at the centre of
its foot on y = 0, front toward +Z (docs/plans/MODEL-ARCHITECTURE.md §1). A place (a camp, a field, a cove) is a Set of
models, not a model. If you are about to model a place, split it first.

## 0. Before you start

- Claim the ask: run `scripts/ask-new.sh "<Jake's words>"` in the main checkout and read its output (parallel sessions
  claim ids in the same second). Keep its Status line true.
- Read the shard's plan (`docs/plans/<SHARD>.md`) and its look:
  - Driftwood is **toon low-poly**: flat-shaded, vertex colour (`COLOR_0` rgb = albedo, a = baked AO), never photoreal.
  - Nalati is **painterly**: one atlas, roughness ~0.85, no normal map.
  - Pine Hollow is **photoreal PBR**: base colour + normal, KTX2.
  - Nine Dragon is **Jiehua**: Nine Dragon's `Kit` with its analytic ruled-line material.
  - Never unify the looks across shards.
- New shards use the baseline HUD. The facade multi-draw ban (AGENTS.md ▸ Rendering regression) covers every model:
  instance, never `BatchedMesh` a facade.
- All art for this job goes in `art/<subject>/round-<n>-<label>/` (the next free round), as JPEG, with a short README
  listing every file.

## 1. The mockup: the model in the game's frame

Show what the model should be **where it will stand**, not on a white void.

1. Take a live capture at iPhone portrait size, the only size Jake reviews at:
   `agent-browser --session <s> set viewport 390 844`, then open
   `https://wildshard-singleplayer.vercel.app/?touch&tier=phone&skipintro&nolock&mute=1&chunk=<slug>` (headless is always muted). Walk or fly to the spot,
   `screenshot`, and `close`.
   - Before you open a browser, check `agent-browser session list` and `pgrep -fl chrome-headless-shell`: at most 3 game
     browsers run on this Mac. Or run inside `scripts/browser-lane.sh`.
2. Edit the capture into the target:
   - **fast, local:** `scripts/mockup-local.sh --ref <capture.jpg> --prompt-file <p.txt> --out <png>` (Qwen-Image, ~30 s;
     `--mask` for a localised edit; run 2–3 seeds);
   - **fidelity:** codex `image_gen` (AGENTS.md ▸ Mockups: the COMMON + SCREEN prompt, one image per run, runs in
     parallel).
   - Make 2–4 variants (A / B / C) when the look is a taste call. Read every image before you use it.
3. If Jake has to choose a direction, stop here. Send one portrait board (§8) and ask with `AskUserQuestion`.

## 2. The reference sheet and the detail list

- **A reference for image-to-3D** is one object, alone, on a plain white background, three-quarter view, whole, and
  unoccluded.
  - Examples: `art/driftwood-isle/round-8-assets/ref-*.jpg`, `art/hud-explorer/round-7-dummy-rebuild/ref-*.jpg`.
  - Make it by editing a crop of the approved mockup (codex or `scripts/mockup-local.sh`) in the shard's style.
  - A sheet of several small objects comes back from TRELLIS as one pile: cut it with `scripts/img2mesh/split_sheet.py`
    first.
  - A figure that will be rigged stands with its arms off its body and closed fists (the dummy lesson, E285).
- **A reference for a code or Blender build** is the same view, plus a front and a side when proportions matter.
- **The detail list** goes in the round's README before any build. Number the identity-defining details: silhouette
  masses, bands and trims, fasteners, carved or painted marks, colour zones, wear. Give each detail the part or material
  that will carry it. When you review, check each number; a detail you can't place on a real part is dropped, not faked.
- **The numbers** go in the same README:
  - height and footprint in metres;
  - the pivot and the front;
  - the triangle budget per tier (desktop / phone / far);
  - how many copies the world will place;
  - what it collides with (box / capsule / hull / treads / none);
  - whether it moves (rig, pivots, sockets).

## 3. Pick the pipeline

Each model gets one pipeline, which becomes its card's badge: CODE · BLENDER · TRELLIS · HUNYUAN · CC0.

| Pipeline | Pick it when | Proven on |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** (TypeScript builder, runs at load) | The shape is parametric or follows game data (stairs with treads, a pier to the terrain, per-copy lean); flat vertex colour or an analytic material; it must change often; its build fits the 30 ms load slices | Driftwood's hut, pier, wreck, palms (`src/world/lowpolyKit.ts`); Nine Dragon's facade and market (`src/chunks/nine-dragon-stack/world/kit.ts`); Nalati's yurt (`src/world/nalati/Yurt.ts`: Jake picked it over the Hunyuan and the Blender yurt, `609f4242`) |
| **TRELLIS.2** (image → mesh, local, MIT) | Organic or sculptural hero props, statues, rocks, plants, creature hulls: things code draws badly | Driftwood hero props, Pine Hollow's 8 hero props, Nalati's 18 models, Nine Dragon's lion and dragon hook, the dummies |
| **Hunyuan3D-2** (image → mesh, local) | The same jobs. It is ~10× faster, and its masses are often more solid. Run it beside TRELLIS and ship the better take. It is as allowed as TRELLIS: never write a territory caveat | the Drowned Captain, Nalati's horses, King, collie, people; Pine Hollow's creatures and NPCs |
| **Blender script** (`scripts/blender/`, runs once, ships a GLB) | It needs an offline bake (Cycles AO or bounce, a normal map, atlases, impostors, lightmaps), bevel / boolean / remesh, a UV unwrap, skin weights, or would cost the phone more to build than to download | the Driftwood cove, Pine Hollow's trees, crags, cave, rifle and knife |
| **CC0** (Poly Haven, Kenney, Quaternius) | A real-world photoscan fits a PBR shard, or a kit piece fits after a palette snap | Pine Hollow's rocks, stump, logs, cabin props; the cove's CC0 palms (`scripts/img2mesh/CC0.md`) |

- If you can't tell, build two (code vs TRELLIS, or TRELLIS vs Hunyuan) and put them side by side (§7). That is how the
  yurt and the Nalati bosses were decided.
- In parallel work, give each subagent one pipeline or one variant and disjoint files.

## 4. Build

Every model builder, whatever the pipeline:
- builds in its own space;
- seeds every random draw (`Rng(seed)` from `src/core/rng.ts`, never `Math.random`);
- gives its colliders in its own space (`ColliderDesc`: box / capsule / ball / hull; `treads` for any stair, rise ≤ 0.35 m,
  tread ≥ 0.36 m; trimesh only for walk-inside shapes; docs: AGENTS.md ▸ Physics);
- never imports Rapier.

### Code

- **Where it goes:** a shared model in `src/models/`, a shard's own in `src/chunks/<slug>/models/` (B1; until M0 lands,
  next to the shard's other builders).
- **Its kit:** the shard's.
  - Toon: `LowPolyKit` (`src/world/lowpolyKit.ts`).
  - Painterly: `PaintKit` (`src/world/nalati/paint.ts`: smooth parts, painted vertex colour, one shared painterly material).
  - Jiehua: Nine Dragon's `Kit` / `KitX`.
  - PBR: the cabin kit in `src/world/Cabin.ts`.
  - Merge each model to one mesh on one shared material. Detail costs triangles, not draw calls.
- **Materials:** go through the shard's material and `sky.setupMaterial(mat)` (docs/SUBAGENT-BRIEF.md), or the shard's
  look breaks.
- **Geometry rules** (from measured failures):
  - pick the surface class before the primitive: an organic form is a lathe or a sweep, never a box; a cable, root or
    rope is a tube;
  - sweep a changing cross-section along parallel-transport frames (Frenet frames flip at an inflection);
  - a crisp edge is a real chamfer (0.02–0.08 of the part, 1–4 segments);
  - parts overlap 0.02–0.05 m at a seam;
  - never scale the root to hide a thing.
- **Mirrored pairs:** a left/right pair is a **reflection**, negate x only. Reflecting flips the triangle winding: flip it
  back, or flat shading lights the part from behind. A 180° turn is not a mirror.
- **Repeats:** a repeat inside a model is merged (or instanced with a slight per-copy cant). Repeats of the model across
  the world are `place()`'s job, not the builder's.

### TRELLIS.2 / Hunyuan3D-2

Both run under the machine-wide model lock. Keep a batch under 30 minutes. Installs, weights and traps:
`scripts/img2mesh/README.md` and `~/projects/localai/docs/3d-models.md`.

```bash
L=~/projects/localai/bin/img2mesh/run-locked.sh
# TRELLIS.2 (1024_cascade by default; --pipeline 512 for a fast pass)
$L ~/ml/img2mesh/logs/<job>.log ~/ml/img2mesh/trellis-mac/.venv/bin/python \
  scripts/img2mesh/trellis_batch.py --out ~/ml/img2mesh/out/<shard> <ref.jpg …>
# Hunyuan3D-2, the same refs
$L ~/ml/img2mesh/logs/<job>-hy.log ~/ml/img2mesh/Hunyuan3D-2/.venv/bin/python \
  ~/projects/localai/bin/img2mesh/hy3d_batch.py --out ~/ml/img2mesh/out/<shard>-hy --shape turbo <ref.jpg …>
```

- **Post (Blender, headless):** add the model to a prop list, `scripts/img2mesh/props/<list>.json` (one row per tier: LOD0,
  `-phone`, `-lod1`), then
  `python3 scripts/img2mesh/build_props.py scripts/img2mesh/props/<list>.json public/assets/models/<dir> <ref>`.
  - Toon shards take the default post: faceted, per-facet colour, AO in `COLOR_0.a`.
  - Photoreal shards pass `--keep-texture`: smooth shading, the texture baked ungraded, a normal map.
  - `scripts/img2mesh/pine_hollow_phone.sh` moves the `-phone` copy to `<ref>.phone.glb`.
- **Traps already paid for:**
  - open plank shells tear under every decimator: `--solidify 0.004 --remesh 0.005`;
  - a flat item comes back as a sheet: `--up x90 --remesh 0.025`;
  - a straight pinnate leaf falls apart;
  - Hunyuan paints palm trunks in stripes;
  - TRELLIS picks a figure's facing per generation, so check it with a render;
  - a boulder decimated to ~800 triangles can show see-through gaps.
- **Compare the takes** under the same light and camera:
  `python3 scripts/img2mesh/versus_board.py <trellis_dir> <hunyuan_dir> <renders_dir> <out.jpg> name=<ref> …`
  (stills from `scripts/img2mesh/render_still.py`).
- **A creature or NPC hull** is rigged on its species' code skeleton: `node scripts/creature-rig-bake.mjs --chunk=<slug>
  --only=<hull>`, needing a vite dev server; Nalati's is `scripts/nalati-rig-bake.mjs`. A standalone rig is modelled on
  `scripts/practice/rig_dummy.py` and gated by `scripts/practice/dummy_rig_gate.py`. Every rig gate checks:
  - weights sum to 1;
  - indices are in range;
  - the bind pose restores;
  - no NaN;
  - no edge stretches over 2× in the pose sweep;
  - every clip really moves its bones (a clip that exists is not a clip that plays).

### Blender script

Read `docs/design/blender-practice.md` first.
- The script is the source; commit the GLB, never a `.blend`.
- Run it `blender -b --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 -P <script> -- <args>` (Blender 5.2.1).
- Take `lockf -k ~/projects/localai/.model.lock` for Cycles bakes or anything over a minute.
- Build into `~/.cache/wildshard-blender/<target>/`, then `pnpm exec gltf-transform meshopt <in> <out> --level medium`,
  then copy into `public/`.
- Existing builders to copy from: `scripts/blender/pine-hollow/{trees,crags,weapons}/`; add a `scripts/blender/targets.json` row and build with `scripts/blender/build.sh` (never commit a `.blend`).

### CC0

- Poly Haven: add the id to `scripts/fetch-assets.mjs` and run `pnpm assets`.
- A heavy photoscan gets an offline LOD (`scripts/simplify-models.mjs`).
- A kit piece on the toon shard gets a palette snap (`scripts/img2mesh/cc0_export.py --family rock|bleach|wood`, via
  `build_cc0.sh`).
- Record the licence and URL in `scripts/img2mesh/CC0.md`.

## 5. LODs, tiers and weight

- **The phone gets its own copy** when it would download or hold less: `<name>.phone.glb` next to `<name>.glb`.
  `src/boot/bytes.ts` `tierUrl` / `phoneUrl` pick it; don't write a branch.
- **Distance LODs:**
  - a `-lod1` file (the TRELLIS props, a quarter of the triangles);
  - a `.far.glb` (Nalati's herds);
  - a two-card impostor (`~/projects/localai/bin/img2mesh/blender_impostor.py`, the tree set's impostor atlas);
  - or a runtime simplified copy (`simplifiedCopy` in `src/chunks/nine-dragon-stack/world/lod.ts`, meshoptimizer).
  - Fade or dither the switch where it pops.
  - Once M0 lands, the LODs go in the model's `lods`, and `place()` applies them.
- **Textures:** every GPU texture gets a KTX2 twin (`node scripts/bake-ktx2.mjs`; add new files to
  `scripts/bake-ktx2.list.json`). Geometry is meshopt-compressed; load with
  `new GLTFLoader().setMeshoptDecoder(MeshoptDecoder)`.
- **Budgets:**
  - the whole phone frame is ~2 M triangles and ~150 draws (Nine Dragon 180);
  - memory is 1.8 GB while loading and 1.0 GB in the Explorer;
  - one model's copies are one draw (instanced or merged), and its card must say which.
  - A new drawing technique needs a physical-iPhone memory reading, not a desktop number (E271 / E272).
- **Commit JPEG / WebP**, not PNG, and keep `progress/` images under 500 KB. The uplink is 10–100 KB/s.

## 6. Register it

- **Today:** `registry.add({ id, name, category, file, object, colliders, surface, floor?, solidFloor, model })`
  (`src/world/registry.ts`). One of a batch, built on view, uses `registerModel({ …, live: false, object, buildAt })`
  (`src/explore/registry.ts`). Never register a built thing twice, and don't push into `player.colliders`.
- **Once M0 lands:** the model is a file that calls `defineModel({ id, name, category, pipeline, file, source?, variants,
  build, lods?, colliders?, rig? })`, and the world places it with `place(model, placements)`. Every `defineModel` is in
  the Model Explorer, and nothing else is. A `pipeline: 'blender'` model names its `source` script.
- **After any collider change:**
  - `node scripts/physics-baseline.mjs --no-build --mode=walk` (and `--trails`): 0 stuck is the bar;
  - if structures moved, `node --experimental-transform-types --import ./scripts/bake-loader.mjs scripts/bake-navmesh.mjs --check`.
- **Check the card** in the Model Explorer (the harness param `?explore=model&chunk=<slug>`):
  - it is under the right tab;
  - the triangles per copy and the draws are what §2 planned;
  - TIERS shows the phone copy;
  - VIEW IN WORLD lands on a real copy.

## 7. Review it yourself first

- **Four views at least:** front, both sides, back, plus three-quarter and top, on the Explorer's turntable at phone
  size. Look for:
  - holes through the model (background showing inside the silhouette);
  - floating parts, and parts sunk into each other;
  - mirrored parts on the wrong side;
  - a wrong pivot (the model hovers or sinks);
  - a wrong front.
  - Never approve from the hero angle alone (shard-checkpoints).
- **Tick the detail list** (§2) against the render, number by number.
- **In the game:** the mockup's camera, then a walk-around, a 12-frame orbit for cutouts, seams and popping. Check it at
  the LOD switch distances, and at dawn and night if the shard has a clock.
- **Cost:**
  - read the draws and triangles on the card;
  - for a model placed hundreds of times, run the shard's GPU ruler (`scripts/nine-dragon-gpu.mjs`,
    `scripts/pine-hollow-gpu.mjs`) before and after;
  - every change is the same or cheaper, or Jake is told the price.
- **Bounded loop:** at most 3 fixes per problem and 6 in total. Stop early when the same defect comes back, a fix undoes
  the last one, or the gain is flat. Then ask Jake, with the evidence, instead of iterating blind.

## 8. Jake's review

- **One portrait board, one image,** labelled A / B / C: mockup · candidate(s) · today's model, at the same camera,
  plus a 4-view strip of the candidate. Use the real in-game frame, not a turntable alone
  (`art/pine-hollow/round-15-rifle/board.jpg` is the pattern).
- **A spin clip** of about 10 s, when the form is the question: `scripts/model-spin.mjs --url=<build> --shard=<slug>
  --models=<id,…> --out=<art path>.mp4`, run inside `scripts/browser-lane.sh` (M9). It turns 1–5 models on the real
  Model Explorer at phone size. Files over 30 MB silently don't arrive.
- **If it's a taste call,** ship both as a Debug variant:
  - a key in `OPTION_VALUES` / `OPTION_SPECS` (`src/ui/Settings.ts`);
  - one `opt(…)` row in `DEBUG_ROWS` (`src/ui/debugOptions.ts`), under its domain's group;
  - never a `?param`.
  - When Jake picks, delete the row, the option and the losing model in one commit.
- **Ask with `AskUserQuestion`,** with a short text summary above it. Don't build further on an unpicked direction.

## 9. Ship

- **Commit** with a pathspec (`git add <new files>`, then `git commit -m "…" -- <paths>`): the model's files, its GLBs,
  its art round.
  - Never `git add -A`, stash, or restore anyone else's files.
  - One model family per commit.
- **Gates:** the push needs the four CI gates green on a clean tree: `tsc --noEmit`, `oxlint`,
  `node scripts/check-css.mjs`, `vite build`.
- **Push** with `scripts/push-main.sh`, and watch that run's CI.
- **Close the ask:** after the hourly deploy, check `/version.json` for the SHA, and write the commit and build id into
  the ask file.
- **Before you report:** close every browser session, and don't leave a model job holding the lock.

## What this skill is not

- Not a promise that a generated model is final. Jake's pick is.
- Not for a whole area's look (docs/design/LOOK-LOOP.md), render bugs, pop-in or performance hunts (show real builds and
  Debug toggles, not mockups), or HUD layouts.
- Not a replacement for the open-source `img2threejs` skill's spec-and-gate machinery. We took six of its ideas (the
  detail list, four views and holes, the mirror rule, surface class before primitive, the bounded loop, the rig-gate
  checklist) and none of its code.
