// own capsule, reading that resident's ground and water, with the resident ticked with no input so everything but the player
// moves as it did. I1 holds it to 2 cm. A rope deck is dynamic and chaotic, and Rapier breaks a tie between two planks by its
// collider tree, so that second world has to grow as the first did: one capsule, rebuilt where each leg rebuilt it. A capsule
// of the `Player`'s own there sent a bridge 11 cm off, with no law wrong.
