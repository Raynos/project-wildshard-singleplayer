"""Pack Pine Hollow's one-shots + barks into ONE audio sprite, and ship its mono-sourced beds mono (PINE-HOLLOW-REMASTER
load lane: the bar fetched the set one file at a time, 228 requests on a phone cold launch against the 180 budget row).

    python3 scripts/music/gen/sfx_sprite.py                          # pack public/assets/sfx/pine-hollow/ (from the shipped files)
    ~/ml/music/analysis/.venv/bin/python scripts/music/gen/sfx_sprite.py --raw <sfx-raw-dir>   # from the lossless takes

Run at the end of sfx_merge.py's merge_ph (which rebuilds public/assets/sfx/pine-hollow/ from the stage dir and would
otherwise un-pack it), and by hand. Idempotent: a set whose sfx.json already has a `sprite` and none of the packed files is
left as it is (the beds step skips a bed that is already mono). A set with a sprite AND new one-shot files (merge_ph
--only: a later round added families) is re-packed: a take already in the sprite is sourced from its lossless take as
ever, or else from its slice of the old sprite's decode; the old clips keep their order (and so their offsets), the new
ones follow, and a clip no family lists any more is dropped.

Sprite. Every file under sfx.json "oneshots" (every family, the barks too) laid end to end on one 48 kHz mono timeline with
GAP (0.2 s) of silence before the first clip, between clips and after the last, encoded as ONE AAC-LC 48 kHz mono .m4a at
the one-shots' own rate (64 kb/s over the sounding part; the silent gaps cost ~nothing), content-addressed `oneshots-<sha1[:8]>.m4a`. sfx.json gets a top-level
    "sprite": {"file": "oneshots-….m4a", "gap": 0.2, "duration": <s>, "clips": {"<original file name>": [startSec, durSec], …}}
(oneshots' family -> files lists and the provenance stay as they are, so provenance still names each take and the game
maps a family's files to their clips), then the individual one-shot files are deleted. A clip's source is its lossless
take re-derived exactly as sfx_build.py shipped it (trim, -18 LUFS, soxr to 48 kHz, mono) when --raw is given and that
re-derivation is the shipped file (lag 0, the same level, correlation >= MATCH_MIN), else the shipped file's own decode
(one AAC generation more).
Offsets are PROVEN, not assumed: the sprite is decoded with ffmpeg AND with afconvert (CoreAudio, Safari's decoder), each
clip's source is cross-correlated against both decodes around its stored start, and the stored start must hold to within
TOL_S (1 ms) in both (the AAC priming is carried by the m4a edit list, which both honour). A table is printed; any miss
fails the run before anything is written or deleted.

Beds (--raw only). A bed whose lossless take is MONO (every MOSS-SoundEffect bed: its model renders one channel) was
shipped as 2 identical channels at 64 kb/s stereo, whose side channel is pure coding noise. It is re-encoded mono from
the lossless take (the seam and the -24 LUFS level exactly as sfx_build.py made them, at the old per-channel level:
UPMIX) with Apple's AAC encoder, content-addressed, at the lowest rate of BED_MONO_KBPS that passes every check: the new
decode lines up with the old one in ffmpeg and in afconvert (lag 0, so loopStart / loopEnd stay valid), afconvert's
decoded length equals the old one and the take's within 1 ms (ffmpeg's carries the encoder's tail padding: recorded as
`duration`), and it is never worse than what shipped (its band at least as wide, its mean spectral error against the
lossless take no larger: the fidelity() numbers). A stereo take (Stable Audio's) keeps its file, and so does a bed
ForestAmbience pans (panned_beds: a StereoPannerNode pans a 2-channel input by another law).
