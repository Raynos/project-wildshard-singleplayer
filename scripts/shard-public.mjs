/** Shards whose public/assets/<slug> tree is gathered too: src/shards/<slug>/assets/public/ holds it, gen writes the aliases.
 * URLs, map inputs and every reader keep the public path, so the move renames nothing they name. To add a shard:
 *  1. Check no live tool writes under public/assets/<slug>. A write lands on a gitignored alias and the next gen overwrites
 *     it, so point the tool at assets/public first. targets.json outputs count: check-model-sources needs them on disk.
 *  2. Move every tracked file there, add the slug here and `/public/assets/<slug>/` to .gitignore, one shard per commit.
 *  3. Prove it from an archive with no aliases: gen, every product by SHA-256 against the parent, and the full
 *     check-closed-components with docs and art present. Scripts and tests read the alias, so their paths don't change.
 * gen only copies: a file deleted here leaves its alias until the folder is cleared. */
